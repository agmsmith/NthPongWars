This is Nth Pong Wars by Alexander G. M. Smith, the February 24th 2025 version.
Notice the green player, who is building up an area of green tiles.
When he has enough, he can start harvesting them for acceleration.
When he's harvesting, you'll see a graphic of little sweeper lines rotating around the player.
They spin faster when more thrust is being harvested, and of course the player speeds up in the joystick specified direction at the same time.
