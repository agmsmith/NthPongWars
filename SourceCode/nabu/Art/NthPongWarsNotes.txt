Nth Pong Wars Music and Sound Effects Assignments.

Which channels play which kind of sound effects...

Channel 0, 1: Purely Tone effects (there is only one noise generator).
Channel 2: White noise based effects, and tone effects.

Music should use the same white noises only in channel 5 rule,
for its channels 3, 4, 5.  Since due to bugs, channel 3 doesn't work once
noise effects start playing.  So there are only 2 music channels: 3, 4.

Effects Tracks, has a silence at the end of each sound so music will be heard
after the sound effect:
0 - Empty
1 - Wall Bip (use channel 0 or 1) 
2 - Tile Bip (use channel 1 or 0)
3 - Harvest (use channel 2)  Instrument xxxxNxxxxxx player number 1-4 variation.
4 - Ball on Ball (use channel 2)


Compiling

Generate the data file in assembler from the .chp music file by using:
chipnsfx -v -l _NthMusic_ -L NthPongWarsMusic.chp NthPongWarsMusic.asm
chipnsfx -v -l _NthEffects_ -L NthPongWarsEffects.chp NthPongWarsEffects.asm

Though for effects, put just one track per channel when saving to get a pure
effect track data block and copy the resulting assembler for that effect into
our NthPongWarsExtractedEffects.asm file.

Then manually append a line at the bottom of each .asm file which exports the
symbols for use from C, like this:
PUBLIC _NthMusic_a_z, _NthMusic_a, _NthMusic_b, _NthMusic_c


Optionally for loading music rather than having it built with the program, can
convert assembler to binary data with:
z80asm -v -l -m -b -o=NthPongWarsMusic.bin NthPongWarsMusic.asm
z80asm -v -l -m -b -o=NthPongWarsEffects.bin NthPongWarsEffects.asm
