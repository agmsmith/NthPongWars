I've finished writing code for doing steering.
But first, we have normal thrust acceleration to get up some speed.
Then we add a second blue player just drifting around.
And now I use steering to direct the green player to hit the blue squares.
And you can see it changing direction without losing speed, the advantage of steering over simple thrusting.
It can even go in circles, again without losing speed.
That also changes the game play, making it easier to target blue squares.
