/* Nth Pong Wars - the multiplayer Pong inspired game.
 * Copyright Â© 2025 by Alexander G. M. Smith.
 *
 * AGMS20240721 Start a NABU version of the game, just doing the basic bouncing
 * ball using VDP video memory direct access, and our fixed point math.
 *
 * Compile for NABU + RetroNet Cloud CP/M (generates a usable .COM file),
 * Optionally with --math32 for 32 bit floating point, uses 5K extra memory.
 * Use this command line to compile the final version (remove
 * max-allocs-per-node for usable speed during development):
 *
 * zcc +cpm -v --list --c-code-in-asm -z80-verb -gen-map-file -gen-symbol-file -create-app -compiler=sdcc -O2 --opt-code-speed=all --max-allocs-per-node200000 --fverbose-asm --math32 -lndos main.c z80_delay_ms.asm z80_delay_tstate.asm l_fast_utoa.asm CHIPNSFX.asm Art/NthPongWarsMusic.asm Art/NthPongWarsExtractedEffects.asm -o "NTHPONG.COM" ; cp -v *.COM ~/Documents/NABU\ Internet\ Adapter/Store/D/0/
 *
 * See https://github.com/marinus-lab/z88dk/wiki/WritingOptimalCode for tips on
 * writing code that the compiler likes and optimizer settings.
 *
 * To prepare to run, create the data files in the server store directory,
 * usually somewhere like Documents/NABU Internet Adapter/Store/NTHPONG/
 * The Art/*.PC2 files are copied as is, the *.DAT text files edited by ICVGM
 * are copied and renamed *.ICV (TODO: convert them to binary for speed).
