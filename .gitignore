# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore various directories, usually 3rd party stuff.
/Key Software/*
/3rd Party Materials/*
/MAME/*

# Ignore some automatically generated files.
*.COM
*.com
*.EXE
*.exe
*.img
*.lis
*.lst
*.map
*.sym

# Ignore some manually generated files.
