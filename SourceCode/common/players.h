/******************************************************************************
 * Nth Pong Wars, players.h for player data structures.
 *
 * The players are represented as ball shaped objects (easier collision
 * detection) and on the NABU are rendered as hardware sprites.  The balls are
 * coloured to reflect the player choice (maybe with a drop-shadow), and
 * animated if a power-up is applied to the object (if several power-ups are
 * active, the animations sequence through the individual power up animations).
 *
 * As they pass over squares on the board which aren't their own colour, they
 * change ownership of the square to the player and then bounce off the square.
 * They have position (in pixels), velocity (pixels per frame) and acceleration
 * (player thrust and world gravity) and bounce off things like walls and other
 * balls.  The collisions are handled with some fancy algorithms so they can
 * move large distances and yet collide with things in the way, and also move
 * slowly at fractional pixels per frame.
