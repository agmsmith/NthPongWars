<H1>NABU Nth Pong Wars Blog</H1>

<P>I'm trying to write an improved version of <I>Pong Wars</I> for the NABU as
a project to become familiar with NABU programming.  Then maybe I can do a
fancy Miniputt golf game.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Pong_Wars_Koen_van_Gilst_version_20240207.png"
ALT="[Screen shot of Pong Wars, Koen van Gilst version]" WIDTH="651"
HEIGHT="687">

<P><I>Pong Wars</I> is a game with a board of <I>width</I> by <I>height</I>
squares and two balls of different colours (black and white usually).
Conveniently, the NABU video display is 32 "characters" wide by 24 rows tall,
and if we use a square rather than a letter in the font, that can be our board.
It's also easily controlled in that mode (rather than fiddling with pixels and
VDP bandwidth limits) and we can do the balls as sprites.

<P>The balls move, controlled by inertia until they hit a square of a colour
that doesn't match the ball's colour.  In that case, the square changes to the
ball's colour and the ball's trajectory reflects (bounces) off the square.  The
balls also bounce off the walls as you would expect.

<P>I'd like to add a ball on ball collision explosion to the game, as they
sometimes get stuck when near each other under the standard rules.  Also, user
input via joystick to accelerate the balls in a selected direction (other games
added paddles but that seems less fun, and for precision really needs paddle
controls rather than joysticks).  And sound effects.  And up to 8 balls (thus
the N in the title, for N up to 8 :-).  And network play with other versions of
the program, possibly running on different types of computer.

<P>After spending an hour last week investigating emulating the <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NABU_Network">NABU personal computer</A> in
hopes of writing something for it, I've decided to keep notes in this blog.  So
that I can remember what happened, and other people can start NABU development
too.

<P>First of course, I was reading some online web site documentation.  Of note are:
<UL>
  <LI><B>NABU RetroNET</B> <A HREF="https://nabu.ca/">https://nabu.ca/</A> - the main site for Nabu software, documentation and preservation of Nabu history.
  <LI><B>The NABU Network</B> <A HREF="https://www.nabunetwork.com/">https://www.nabunetwork.com/</A> - a copy-cat rival site of all things Nabu, notable for news.
  <LI><B>Links</B> <A HREF="https://gtamp.com/nabu/">https://gtamp.com/nabu/</A> - a page of links to Nabu emulators, Internet Adapter software varieties, forums.
  <LI><B>NABU-Library</B> <A HREF="https://github.com/DJSures/NABU-LIB">https://github.com/DJSures/NABU-LIB</A> - is a code library by D. J. Sures to make writing NABU programs easier, targeting both CP/M and bare NABU systems.
  <LI><B>Z88DK</B> <A HREF="https://z88dk.org/site/">https://z88dk.org/site/</A> - is a C compiler and assembler for a large variety of Z80 CPU computers.
  <LI><B>SDCC</B> <A HREF="https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/</A> the Small Device C Compiler used by ZCC.

Some people want to port it to older 8 bit computers too.
  <LI><B>Javascript version of <I>Pong Wars</I></B> <A HREF="https://pong-wars.koenvangilst.nl/">https://pong-wars.koenvangilst.nl/</A> - Play Koen van Gilst's version of <I>Pong Wars</I> in your web browser.  This web page inspired the Nth Pong Wars project.

</UL>

<P>Then I spent some time reading the source code of the various
implementations of <I>Pong Wars</I> from the
<A HREF="https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars?tab=readme-ov-file#alternate-version">list
on Github</A>.  The bugs and feature requests list for Koen's version also
suggest a few ideas and improvements.  Odd that they all iterate over the whole
array of squares to draw the screen repeatedly, rather than just doing changed
squares.  A sign of having too much CPU power!

<H3><A NAME="DevEnvSetup"></A>Setting up a Development Environment</H3>

<P>I'm using Fedora 39 Linux.  Fortunately a lot of the needed tools have
already been packaged.

<H4>Install MAME</H4>

<P>So to install MAME (an emulator which handles the NABU, currently version
0.262):<BR>
<CODE>dnf install mame mame-data-software-lists mame-doc mame-tools</CODE>

<P>Note that stock MAME 0.270 is the last working version in Fedora 41 Linux,
versions 0.271 to 0.275 don't work (serial port connection to the NABU fake
server doesn't go through).  Actually, it turns out that if you bump the
serial port stop bits to 2, it works in those later versions.

<H4>C Compiler</H4>

<P>And for the C compiler and assembler:<BR>
<CODE>dnf install z88dk</CODE><BR>
(actually, that doesn't work, no NABU subsystem, see later on for a source code
based install)

<H4>Network Simulator</H4>

<P>For the NABU Network Adapter server (simulates the NABU network distributing
files to NABU computers), I'm starting with the one from Nabu.ca:

<OL>
  <LI>Download the appropriate one (Linux x86 for me) from
    <A HREF="https://nabu.ca/downloads-nabu-internet-adapter">https://nabu.ca/downloads-nabu-internet-adapter</A>
  <LI>Unzip it and move the files to ~/bin/ or somewhere in your path.
  <LI>Add a link named ~/bin/libdl.so that points to the actual location and
    file of that dynamic loader library.  Using the command "locate libdl", I
    found it at /usr/lib64/libdl.so.2, thus the command is:
    <CODE>ln -s /usr/lib64/libdl.so.2 ~/bin/libdl.so</CODE>
  <LI>Test it by typing NABU-Internet-Adapter-84 in a Terminal window.  It
    should draw a nice text mode user interface (make Terminal window bigger to
    see more).  Arrow keys, tab and Enter let you navigate around the menus.
    It seems to save files in ~/NABU Internet Adapter/
</OL>

<P>And that's as far as I have gotten.  Hope to run MAME next and see the stock
NABU boot screen.

<H3>MAME Not Working</H3>

<P>I started MAME setup by copying some of the files from
GTAMPs "nabu-mame.zip" for Windows into a new MAME directory in my user account.
I was looking for configuration and other similar files, which weren't specific
to the Windows OS MAME that the .zip file includes.  I also converted the
nabu.cmd batch file into a NabuStart.sh bash script file.

<P>Boots, but doesn't run the network - RetroNet adapter says it got FF rather
than some start sequence.  Later on I found it was due to a low baud rate
setting on the simulated serial port that the NABU talks to the NABU network
adapter.

<H3>Try nabud instead:</H3>

<P>Add "nabu" user and group.<BR>
<CODE>useradd --create-home --comment "NABU Network Server" nabu</CODE>

<P>Add to dialout group, in case we ever have a real serial port.<BR>
<CODE>gpasswd --add nabu dialout</CODE>

<P>Add a password.<BR>
<CODE>passwd nabu</CODE>

<P>Log in as nabu user.  Get the source code:<BR>
<CODE>git clone https://github.com/thorpej/nabud.git</CODE><BR>
Then run "./configure", "make", and as root "make install" in the nabud
directory.

<P>After all that, "man nabud" should give you the documentation, and there's a
README on the GitHub page.
<A HREF="https://github.com/thorpej/nabud">https://github.com/thorpej/nabud</A>

<P>Install Linux systemd settings for nabud by doing:<BR>
<CODE>cp -v /usr/local/share/nabud/systemd/nabud.service /etc/systemd/system/</CODE><BR>
Put a configuration file nabud.conf in /usr/local/etc/nabud.conf (trimmed down
from one of the examples).<BR>
Then you can "systemctl status nabud", and use the enable and stop/restart
commands as desired.

<P>Then I tried it again, and get "Got unexpected message 0xff".  Same problem
as with Nabu.ca Network Adapter.  Maybe MAME needs a newer version or different
ROMS or settings (actually was serial port speed).

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.02.20"></A>2024.02.20</H2>

<H3>Look for ROMs and config files for MAME</H3>

<P>Known working config for MAME found in
<A HREF="https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?t=17">https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?t=17</A>.

<P>ROMs in the Quiver at Nabu.ca are the same as in the GTAMPs "nabu-mame.zip"
But there's a mention in the Nabu.ca forums that ROM version 14 is a hacked up
version, possibly adding to the communication protocols?  Discussion found at
<A HREF="https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?p=951">https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?p=951</A>.
Turns out to be the same as the GTAMP nabupc-u53-ver14-2732.bin file.

<P>Noticed that in the other .cmd files from GTAMP, some start MAME with a
<CODE>-bios ver14</CODE> argument, or ver17.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.02.21"></A>2024.02.21</H2>

<H3>Serial Port Settings?</H3>

<P>From a post on the Vintage Computer Federation
<A HREF="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/nabu-pc-emulation-under-mame.1241092/page-16">https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/nabu-pc-emulation-under-mame.1241092/page-16</A>
they mentioned setting the baud rate in the emulator to 111900, and that the
<B>Scroll Lock</B> key followed by Tab can bring up the MAME menu when running
(so that you can change the serial port speed).  Mine was at 9600 baud.  And of
course there's no scroll lock key on my laptop keyboard, so I had to dig up a
USB keyboard just to press that button.

<P>How about the other serial port settings?
<A HREF="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=122002">https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=122002</A>
says 111900 baud in both directions, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow
control.  Still didn't work.

<P>Later on, with MAME 0.271 and later, you need 2 stop bits for some reason.
And since it's simulated, might as well pick the fastest serial port speed the
emulated hardware can run at (115200 baud).

<H3>Start Over!</H3>

<P>I wiped out my MAME directory and restored it from GTAMP's .zip file.  MAME
complained about not finding a keyboard rom; I just had to move the
nabukeyboard*.bin files out from the roms/nabu_kb directory into roms/nabupc.
MAME stopped complaining about missing ROMs and it started working!  If it
finds no ROMs at all, you may also need to add a path to the ROMs using the MAME
settings menu, since the default paths are to /usr/share.  Using the -bios
option to pick a rom was apparently causing problems, I just needed to use the
defaults.  Argh!

<P>This command line works (after you get to the MAME menu via the scroll-lock
and tab key, and fix the serial port settings, and have one of the Nabu Network
simulators running in the background on TCP port 5816).  By the way, you can
make the window dimensions larger or smaller as you wish for readability:<BR>
<CODE>mame nabupc -window -resolution 1024x768 -hcca null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:5816</CODE>

<P>It even worked with both Network Adapter simulators, nabud and the Nabu.ca
NABU Internet Adapter.

<P>Later note - some versions of MAME are broken, like 0.271 not talking to the
Nabu Internet Adapter (0.270 works, around November 2024).

<P>Next up, try compiling an example program and get it running.

<H2><A NAME="2024.02.27"></A>2024.02.27</H2>

<H3>How to Compile?</H3>

<P>After a bit of reading and then trying out CP/M (manual and reference card
PDFs exist) in a simulated NABU computer running in MAME, I'm ready to start
programming.  I'm looking at <A
HREF="https://github.com/DJSures/NABU-LIB">https://github.com/DJSures/NABU-LIB</A>
which documents how to set up a development environment and how to compile
programs for the NABU.  Looks like the best way to run the game is under CP/M,
rather than on bare hardware.  That way you can save games to disk, there's
library code for running the hardware (text, graphics, sound, joysticks, serial
data, interrupts, disk access, network access).  Hopefully that will make it
easier to get started with writing the game.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.03.03"></A>2024.03.03</H2>

<P>Try to get the compiler working.  Of course, it doesn't, get warnings about
#warning statements in the library's header file.  Hours of frustration ensue.

<P>Try a Hello World simple C program.  Can't find zpragma command.  Try again,
with zcc environment variables set to /usr/share/z88dk/... can't find nabu.cfg.
But can find cpm.cfg.  Look at arguments, turn off "-vn" which hides what zcc
is doing!

<PRE>cp /usr/share/z88dk/lib/config/../..//lib/cpm_crt0.opt /tmp/tmpXXxzT5zg.opt
cp /tmp/tmpXXxzT5zg.opt /tmp/tmpXXxzT5zg.asm
zcpp -I. -DZ80 -DCPM -D__CPM__  -DZ88DK_USES_SDCC=1 -I/usr/share/z88dk/lib/config/../..//include  main.c /tmp/tmpXXFsyuOI.i2
zpragma  < /tmp/tmpXXFsyuOI.i2 > /tmp/tmpXXFsyuOI.i
sh: line 1: zpragma: command not found</PRE>

<P>Looks like it does really need a zpragma command, and none exists.
Deinstall ZCC with <CODE>dnf remove z88dk</CODE> and then download the source
and build zcc and sdcc.  Instructions at
<A HREF="https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation">https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/installation</A>.
I just did a home directory install (not a system-wide install) of the
March 3 2024 version (plenty of older versions are around and there's a
Git repository too for easier reversions, might want to use 2.3 from 20.12.2023
which was before a SDCC compiler change, though I see a NABU change in
February 2024).

<P><CODE>git clone --recursive  https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk.git<BR>
dnf install gcc g++ gdb make bison flex libxml2-devel subversion zlib-devel m4
ragel re2c dos2unix texinfo texi2html curl perl cpanminus ccache boost

perl-Capture-Tiny perl-Path-Tiny perl-Text-Table perl-Data-HexDump
perl-Regexp-Common perl-Clone perl-File-Slurp pkg-config gmp-devel patch</CODE>

<P>Then continue on with the rest of the instructions, installing Perl modules
(as root do <CODE>cpan App::Prove CPU::Z80::Assembler Data::Dump Data::HexDump
File::Path List::Uniq Modern::Perl Object::Tiny::RW Regexp::Common Test::Harness
Text::Diff Text::Table YAML::Tiny</CODE>), running the z88dk compiler build,
and then adding environment variables (ZCCCFG) to your .bashrc so ZCC is
runnable.  Finally try compiling a NABU CP/M Hello World from NABU-LIB.

<P>The tools to make a hard drive disk image for remote access are Windows
versions, so instead copy the .COM file to <I>NABU Internet
Adapter/Store/D/0</I> and see if it shows up in Cloud CP/M on drive D user 0.
Need to use the "CPMDRIVE B" command within the NABU emulation, then it
appears (there's an option in later NABU Network Adapters to automatically do
this).

<P>Yay!  After 4 hours, got my Hello world test working.  Whew.  That's enough
for today.  Next, try compiling NABU hardware library stuff and see if the
example games work.

<H3>Regressing Z88DK to Compile NABU-LIB and DJ's Examples</H3>

<P>I tried compiling <I>Brick Battle</I>, but lots of errors appear in the
NABU-LIB code; you see this many times (note - newer Z88DK versions circa 2025
fix this, no need to use an older Z88DK):
<PRE>main.c:742: warning 283: function declarator with no prototype
main.c:855: error: syntax error
  ^---- ld ( 0xff00 ), hl
      ^---- ldh(0),hl
</PRE>

<P>The forums <A
HREF="https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?t=207">https://forums.nabu.ca/viewtopic.php?t=207</A>
say something broke in Z88DK in May 2023.  A hint: the left over listings of
working code examples in NABU-LIB use version 4.2 of the SDCC compiler.

<P>So first try compiling z88dk release 2.3 (December 20 2023), from this
particular commit: <A
HREF="https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/commit/51889e53005df1258e1a437bc68e6c4f33b63786">https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/commit/51889e53005df1258e1a437bc68e6c4f33b63786</A>
and see what version of the compiler it has.  4.3.0 is the version, too new,
and it doesn't work just as before.

<P>Go back in Git history and get Z88DK from May.  Actually, it looks like the
switch to SDCC 4.3.0 was done on February 6 2023, so try the change just before
it, from February 3rd <CODE>git checkout -b NABU-LIB-Compatible
--recurse-submodules 492cb971987d88f91d2b046ce99d5bd34f6fadea</CODE>.  The
build process fetches http://nightly.z88dk.org/zsdcc/zsdcc_r13131_src.tar.gz
(hmmm, actual version number is slightly earlier).  And when compiled, it
compiles without silly errors!  The listing says:<BR>
<CODE>Version 4.2.0 #13081 (Linux)</CODE>

<P>Now does it run?  I see that it loads the title screen picture off the
Nabu.ca network (it's in a subdirectory too).  And music is included as
compiled data.  Yay!  Music and title screen.  Plays with sound effects and
everything in MAME, and exits nicely to CP/M too.  Okay, we're finally in
business after yet another long afternoon trying to get the build system
working.  Whew!

<P>Shortcut to build the right version of Z88DK in one shot (after installing
the software the builder needs) under Linux:<BR>
<CODE>git clone https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk.git ; cd z88dk ; git checkout -b NABU-LIB-Compatible 492cb971987d88f91d2b046ce99d5bd34f6fadea ; git submodule update --init --recursive ; export BUILD_SDCC=1 ; export BUILD_SDCC_HTTP=1 ; ./build.sh ; cd ..</CODE>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.03.05"></A>2024.03.05</H2>

<P>Look at the later NABU bug fix in 2859b2b64b5797f2eb4bf944785423a801b40e0c,
but that seems to use a whole mostly new runtime system to do graphics,
paddles, vt-100 terminal emulation etc, overlapping with NABU-LIB quite a lot.
So either use the old Z88DK and NABU-LIB or use the newer Z88DK runtime without
NABU-LIB.

<P>Compile <I>Brick Battle</I>, read the game code, look at compiler output
(array access gets simpler if player array structures are 8 bytes rather than 5
bytes), hack it up a bit.

<H2><A NAME="2024.03.11"></A>2024.03.11</H2>

<H3>NABU-LIB Functionality?</H3>

<P>Read source code for NABU-LIB and see what functionality it provides:

<UL>
  <LI>NabuTracker - Music from MIDI files, 2 note channels and one noise or
    note channel.  Each note specifies beat #, on/off, channel, pitch, volume.
    Update function called every 1/16 note time (processes all notes with same
    beat number).  C# utility to convert .mid files to NabuTracker source code
    format.
  <LI>Lots of remote commands to the Internet Adapter to open files
    (rn_fileOpen etc), network connections and URLs to read or write them.
    Might be dependent on using the Nabu.ca Internet Adapter software as the
    server side for that extra functionality.  Also CP/M virtual remote disk
    support, which you'd access via the usual CP/M APIs.
  <LI>Font loading (as data in a header file) for text and graphics modes, with
    several fonts to choose from.  Also terminal emulation with cursor, so you
    can print to the screen without using CP/M.
  <LI>Text mode double buffer in main RAM, so only changes have to be copied to
    the slow VDP memory.  Also implements a cursor and scrolling.  And a hook
    into the BIOS CP/M cursor position get/set, and the whole suite of VT52
    operations (clear to end of line, etc).
  <LI>VDP init in various modes, load patterns, print text, draw high-res dots,
    move sprites.  Some assumptions such as sprites not animated (same pattern
    name for a given sprite ID).
  <LI>Keyboard access, isKeyPressed() is non-blocking.  Also get a character or
    a line.
  <LI>Non-blocking Joystick access.
  <LI>Can add VDP interrupt handlers.  Buffered VDP interrupt enable register
    (the real one is write only).  Other registers are also buffered in CPU
    RAM.
  <LI>Can create programs for homebrew mode (your program + NABULIB controls
    the hardware directly) or CP/M mode or a mixture.
  <LI>Can turn off various features to save space if you don't need them.
  <LI>Has a debug feature to see if your code takes more than one frame to run.
  <LI>Music - can play a note (has a table of MIDI notes to frequency codes).
    Also low level AY-3-8910 programmable sound generator chip access.
  <LI>Support for regular NABU interrupt system.
  <LI>Access the HCCA (Home Cable Computer Adapter) network interface.
    Background interrupt to fill a receive buffer, API to get buffer contents.
    Glue functions to get/send data as various size/sign integers.

<P>Continue reading NABU-LIB.h at line 1077, VDP functions.  Finished .h, and
then read NABU-LIB.c, with a side trip to check out how RetroNET-FileStore.*
works (writes and reads codes over the HCCA serial port to the server to open
files, etc, on the server and use a handle number to refer to them on the
NABU).  Overall, several copy and paste documentation errors, works as expected
and not super optimised so it's understandable.

<H3>Z88DK NABU Support?</H3>

<P>Want to look at the zcc compiler NABU support.  Start by getting latest zcc
source and compiling the compiler.  It uses zsdcc_r14648_src.tar.gz for the
underlying compiler.  Then search for files with "nabu" in them.  See
z88dk/include/arch/nabu.h and directory z88dk/include/arch/nabu/.

<UL>
  <LI>Has TMS9918 video code for graphics and terminal text displays, actually
    a library written for some other computer, goes up to 3D flat shaded
    polygons.
  <LI>Functions for accessing the HCCA network, with interrupt driven reads (to
    a ring buffer) and writes.
  <LI>Interrupt system glue code, and keyboard+joystick+paddle and VDP
    interrupt handling.
  <LI>Sound generator API, but no music player.
  <LI>Includes RetroNet API for remote file & URL access.  See files in
    z88dk/libsrc/target/nabu/retronet/
  <LI>Lots of examples, 2 NABU specific (RetroNet test, input test), rest are
    MSX ones, like slowly using lines to draw an Earth globe, or a spaceship
    that shoots while over a colourful scrolling river background, or a Tron
    light cycle game (Snakes) with sound.
  <LI>Has various number libraries, from F48 floating point to 16 bit fixed
    point.  And matrix operations from the 3D library which adapts to use
    whatever underlying number system you use for your math library (see
    z88dk/include/lib3d.h).
</UL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.04.07"></A>2024.04.07</H2>

<P>So, best bet for portability and future compilation is to use Z88DK NABU
support and the newer compiler.  But keep an eye on NABU-LIB for useful code.

<H3>Game Design</H3>

<P>Next up - game design.  What do I want in the game?

<UL>
  <LI>Nth Pong Wars stand-alone operation with zero players, just as a kind of
    screen saver and initial proof of concept.
  <LI>Have N balls of different colours, maybe limit it to 4 due to NABU sprite
    limits.  Also allow different sized balls, useful for bonus effects.
  <LI>Tiles are done as 8x8 pixel character blocks.  Top row on the screen is
    reserved for score, so 32 wide x 23 tall tiles = 736 tiles.  Each tile shows
    the current owner's colour and maybe fade or modify to show other tile
    properties, like power-ups.
  <LI>Score.  Count of number of tiles owned by each colour.  Displayed in the
    background layer, 4 numbers each 3 digits and a space in player's colour
    across the top of the screen.  Tile count or percentage of total tiles or
    both or a menu option?
  <LI>Idea from Atari 2600 version - a score limit, game over when the highest
    player tile count reaches the limit.  Optionally, the limit slowly
    decreases over time, adding a sense of urgency to playing the game.
    Display the limit on the score row too.
  <LI>Main menu to choose options.  Save options to a settings file.
  <LI>High score table.  Ask for initials.  Store in a CP/M file on C: drive
    since that's the writable drive.  Date stamp too so they know when they last
    played or can show all-time, yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly champs.
    Maybe also share the high scores across the network and have regional
    high score boards too.  But don't show too many boards, just the ones the
    players are interested in (ones they are on).
  <LI>Player interaction.  Use the joystick to add some acceleration to a
    particular ball, multiple player support (up to 4 joysticks).  Fire button
    activates special effects when held down.
  <LI>AI players for unassigned balls (if no joystick inputs after a while, the
    AI takes over).
  <LI>Network play, up to 4 players total, with 0 to 4 per computer (so you can
    have spectators), dynamic joining and leaving the game with AI players
    taking over when joystick operators are away.
  <LI>Staleness.  After time the tiles fade to a background colour.  Maybe even
    vanish back to neutral, or to the worst player's colour to give them a
    boost?
  <LI>Burn some of your tiles to do special effects, like have a larger ball or
    more acceleration when using the joystick.  Perhaps have power-up bonuses
    that change the special effect when you run over them.
  <LI>Sound effects for collisions, ball-ball and ball-tile.  Maybe vary a bit
    in pitch to reflect player's number.  Secondary sound effects for burning
    tiles (affected by player), accelerating (player and acceleration direction
    influence it).  Allow stacking of sound effects so several things happening
    at once play out.
  <LI>Background music, probably not possible in the game on the NABU with all
    those sound effects, but definitely for the menus.
  <LI>Score bubbles.  Rise from the spot where the points are gained, fall from
    the spot where points are lost (just use the player's current position).
    Maybe only show score changes over a limit, to avoid clutter and not have
    to make too many different sprite bubble graphics.
</UL>

<H3>Code Design</H3>

<P>Possible ways of implementing the game design.

<UL>
  <LI>Portable core code in C so it can run on other computer system types,
    like BeOS or Linux.  The simulation code, game state and network protocol
    should be the same for all platforms for portability reasons.
  <LI>Allow for other screen sizes for running on other computer system
    types or as a game variation on the NABU.  NABU may be able to keep track
    of larger playfields if there is enough memory, but only show a window into
    the larger area (perhaps following the active players center of mass).
  <LI>Design for network play, one main computer controls the game, clients
    forward joystick inputs.  Main computer sends out a data dump every once in
    a while (ideally every frame) with a list of state changes (a small list is
    good for VDP and network bandwidth limits).
  <LI>Dynamically add and remove remote players.  Clients can send special
    opcodes to request the whole screen when joining the game, or a copy of the
    game state data in case they want to take over running the game.
  <LI>Dynamically add and remove local players.  Have AI take over or delete
    idle players (get down to a two player screensaver game if idle long
    enough).  Possibly this means that the menu doesn't ask for the number of
    players, just add a ball if joystick activity is detected.
  <LI>Use graphics I mode, so changing a tile is just a single byte write,
    though will need to duplicate the score digits with different colours for
    each set.  Also have ASCII font in white and the tiles in each of 4
    colours.  Maybe also have faded tiles (done with dithering) since we have 8
    tiles per colour palette entry.  And power-up tiles.  Or use multicolour
    mode 64x46 tiles and display score with sprites.
  <LI>Balls are done with sprites, up to 16x16, one sprite per ball.  Or maybe
    have a second one for a shadow, but use lower priority ones for that to
    avoid having the ball flicker.  Also have balls from 1 pixel to 16 pixels
    in diameter.  Ball image is left and top justified within the sprite
    rectangle.  Maybe also show power-up effects by changing ball graphics,
    perhaps animating them?  Though for the large ball power-up, it's self
    evident.
  <LI>Use fractional 16 bit integers (2's complement sign + 9 bit integer +
    6 bit fraction, values up to 511 + 63/64th) for velocity and position in
    pixels per frame.  Need a bit more than 256 since the NABU screen is 256
    pixels wide.  Implies maximum game board size is 63 tiles tall or wide.
  <LI>Coordinate system uses pixels, zero based like the Macintosh (not BeOS
    which awkwardly used centers of pixels for integer coordinate points), top
    left corner of pixel is (0,0), x increases to right, y increases down,
    bottom right pixel corner is (1,1), tiles cover 8 pixels, tile center is at
    (4.0, 4.0) with four pixels on either side of the center.
  <LI>Simulation math.  Need collision detection between ball and ball or ball
    and tile.  Start with ad-hoc like the other examples use, then move to ball
    as a circle intersecting tile rectangles.  Handle multiple tile
    intersections per frame by considering shape of circle moving through space
    to figure which tile it hits first, then bounce off tile and consider next
    collision, until ball has moved its whole frame velocity distance.<BR>
    Hmmm, rather than calculating edge collisions and dot products, find the
    tiles under the current ball shape (ball size can vary, tile center distance
    to ball center has to be less than ball radius + tile radius) and find
    them all.  If they are the player's colour already, no change needed.  Other
    tiles get owned by the player and also affect the ball motion.  Make a 2D
    net vector sum of all the non-player tiles relative to the ball center, and
    use that to bounce (reflect, reverse) the ball velocity component that's in
    the same direction.  Can be a classic bounce, or if there is a ball push
    through obstacles power-up active, it just adds friction proportional to the
    vector length.  And of course, classic bounce off the board edge.  And ball
    on ball collision detection and resulting explosions.
  <LI>Fractional movement math (use 16 bit fixed point numbers), so can move
    faster than 1 square per frame.  Makes collision detection more
    complicated, can hit several tiles in one frame.  So do the simulation in
    smaller steps than a single frame, moving the balls in steps of at
    most half a tile at a time (fastest ball moves half a tile, others move
    proportionally slower), then redoing collision tests (don't want to do one
    ball then the others, want to detect mutual ball collisions more
    realistically).  Repeat until the balls have all moved their velocity per
    frame distance.  That way the ball won't skip over tiles if it is going too
    fast.
  <LI>Keep track of each player's tiles in a queue so we can burn their oldest
    tiles as needed.  Linked list would be best, since we have to remove tiles
    in the middle as the opponents take them.  Each global tile record would
    have a forward and back pointer.  Burnt tiles can turn into empty tiles or
    into power-ups.
  <LI>After the simulation update for a frame has been done to the in-memory
    tile and ball state, go through and extract a list of changes, using
    opcodes (like tile position & new colour, ball position, score change,
    sound effect) and then send it out to clients and also run it against our
    own VDP.  Clients send back a similar list of opcodes for joystick and
    other inputs.

<H2><A NAME="2024.04.14"></A>2024.04.14</H2>

<P>Yet more game design, and code design, they're kind of a continuum of design
and not really separate.  Stealing lots of ideas, and coming up with a few
new variations.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.04.16"></A>2024.04.16</H2>

<P>Wonder how well you can do 16 bit fixed point integers on the Z80, what does
the generated code look like?

<P>Write some test code, we have a 6 bit fraction and 10 bit integer part,
adding works by just using signed 16 bit integers, but we need to divide by 64
to get the integer portion.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.04.21"></A>2024.04.21</H2>

<P>Continue with fixed point speed tests, trying to get the compiler to not
optimise everything out by putting the code in a subroutine with arguments,
rather than in-line with constants.

<P>Ugh, divide a 16 bit integer by 64 is <CODE>sra d; rr e;</CODE> repeated 6
times, totalling 24 bytes of opcodes.  Floating point is even worse, with lots
of code to just put the 4 byte arguments on the stack to set up a library call.

<P>Comparing against 2 byte integers, it looks like 4 byte integers take twice
as long, and 4 byte floating point numbers take 8 times longer.  Since it's
kind of non-standard to use 16 bit fixed point other than 8.8 bits (we want
10.6 for pixel coordinates), 32 bit integers in a 16.16 fixed point format
would be safer and easier for the computer to shift to get the integer or
fraction portion.  32 bit integers will give us enough numeric range and be
well supported on all computers.

<P>But how fast is math on the Z80?  2 seconds for 50000 calls to a subroutine
that adds two 16 bit ints, 4 seconds for 32 bit ints, 15 seconds for 32 bit
floats.  Yes, there is some loop and subroutine call overhead, but that's close
enough for estimates.

<P>So, how much math do we need?  Most is collision detection, finding the
tiles inside a circle around a ball.  The biggest ball is 32 pixels in
diameter, so 4x4 tiles or 16 tiles (well, maybe 5x5 for half tiles around the
edge).  Distance from a tile to ball would be an (X, Y) vector, so 2
subtractions to calculate it.  Can use a table to go from X (varies from 0 to
ball radius plus tile radius = 20) to X squared (whew, expensive multiplication
avoided), one more addition to add X^2 + Y^2 to get distance squared (avoid
doing square root, work with squared pixel length) and a subtraction to do the
comparison (<B>draw tiles as circles to match the math and look better</B> -
in-joke: have a spherical cow Easter egg).  So 4 add/subtracts per tile, 16
times, totalling 64 additions per ball.  4 balls, so 256 additions.  60 frames
per second, so 15360 additions per second just for tile collisions.  And we can
do 25000 additions per second for 16 bit math, or 12500 for 32 bit integers.
Looks like we should use 16 bit integers to be safe, or use 32 and run at 30
frames per second.

<P>So start with 32 bit fixed point math and allow for the possibility of
rewriting as 16 bit if we don't have enough speed.

<H2><A NAME="2024.04.25"></A>2024.04.25</H2>

<P>Looked at ncurses, seems like it could show the tile field quite easily for
Linux and BeOS in terminal mode, since it renders an array of characters to a
screen.  Also has support for menus and windows.  Should be easier to debug in
a terminal in a modern OS rather than on a NABU screen.  Nobody uses ncurses on
Z88DK since the library is several kilobytes large.

<P>Spent a while trying to get ncurses to do anything, turns out you need to
read a character else it doesn't draw anything (or it draws and erases it too
quickly to see it).  Also, can do colour, which will be good for the game!

<H3>Bouncing Ball using Fixed Point Math</H3>

<P>Code just a ball bouncing off the walls, to get started.  Uses ncurses for
output, keyboard for input, should compile in Linux and then BeOS.

<P>Yeah!  It works.  The 16.16 bit fixed point math seems to work correctly,
and I got ncurses running in real time (specified as 20 frames per second) and
in colour.

<P>You can also see the <A HREF="main_20240501.c">source code in C</A> for this
version.

<P>Next up, design the main data structures for the balls and tiles.  And
algorithms for evenly advancing positions of multiple balls moving faster than
one tile per frame.  Hmmm, might also need a sorted tree of tile updates to
find runs of changes for faster NABU VDP video chip writes and better network
data compression.

<H2><A NAME="2024.07.21"></A>2024.07.21</H2>

<P>I'm back, after a Fringe Theatre Festival and cottage maintenance kept me
busy.  I moved the fixed point math to a header file, and then redid it as
function calls, so that later we can use 3 byte integers in assembler code on
the Z80.

<P>Today I'm trying to make a Z80 version of the ncurses simple ball bouncing
around test, trying to use the Z88DK libraries first (freshly updated Z88DK)
and directly accessing the video memory.  Got as far as getting the fixed point
math to compile on both Z80 and Linux.

<H3>Initialising Graphics Mode and Fast Loops</H3>

<P>Got some test code working with NABU-LIB for the first time.  It initialises
things in graphics mode 2, including loading the font in 3 parts (video memory
is triplicated to get the extra graphics resolution, with font tile patterns
and colours repeated for each third of the screen).  I had it load garbage into
the first 32 non-printing characters, thus the cleared screen around the
printed text looks blobby.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="First_Mode_2_Graphics_20240725.jpeg"

HEIGHT="507">

<P>Also had a look at generated code and was able to rewrite a nested for loop
pair into a zero based do-while, which is faster and shorter.  There's no
re-loading the loop variable and comparing it to a constant, also you can use
an 8 bit counter rather than 16 to cover all 256 numbers in a do-while.

<H3>Editing Graphics</H3>

<P>Cottage season is over, so there's less time taken up by maintenance.
Headers are coming along, and I need to start coding, with an eye to visual
feedback.  Thus I need to make some sprites.

<P>I decided on 16x16 pixel mode.  Unfortunately if you set a mode (8x8, 16x16
or doubled), it applies to all sprites, so you can't have a mixture of ones
that are smaller and larger.  Instead, I'll use the highest resolution mode for
better detail and make a smaller ball inside it.  Though 16x16 limits it to a
total of 64 frames of animation in video memory.  The space around the ball
will show power-up animations (such as faster speed, larger ball).  And we may
have a darker shadow sprite under the ball to show height above ground and a
sparkle sprite to add extra colour to the power-up animations and ball.

<P>So what tools are there to make sprites?  Looking at the
<A HREF="https://nabu.ca/downloads-quiver">Quiver</A> I settled on ICVGM, from
2005, runs on Windows.  It also does font and screen editing, as well as
sprites.  No docs included, but I found the author and a document with a chapter
on ICVGM, search for
<A HREF="https://html.duckduckgo.com/html?q=ICVGM%20Daniel%20Bienvenu">"ICVGM
Daniel Bienvenu"</A> to find everything related to it.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ICVGMFontAndSprite20241101.png"
ALT="[Screen shot of ICVGM editing font and sprites]" WIDTH="768" HEIGHT="474">

<P>I added colourful font characters to show the score for each player and
started on some sprites, with a bit of animation, so I'm forced to add
animation to the game code :-).  As you can tell, I've picked colours for each
player, ones which are distinctive and also have a couple of shades so we can
do a shadow and sparkle too.  There weren't too many choices; the palette is so
limited!

<P>I should add some tiles to the character set, one for each player
colour.  Maybe an embossed set to show tiles starting to expire or for some
other special effect?  Or a gradient, since each scan line can have a different
colour.  Nope, that looks bad (evolves to little squares in a square), try a
square with a bigger border, which looks more solid than the square with a
single pixel border.  Yeah, that could work.

<H3>Full Screen Pictures</H3>

<P>I side tracked today to look at doing full screen bitmap pictures.  There's
a .SC2 file format which is basically a dump of the 7 VDP registers followed
by a dump of all of video memory, so it can set up fonts, screen contents and
sprites.  But how to make that, and how to load it?

<P>So how do you make a picture, with dithering and colour choices to
approximate a higher quality image on the NABU TMS9918A video processor?
The Convert9918 project in the Quiver looked good (several different colour
matching choices and dithering algorithm choices), but it needs a recent Windows
to run, and I don't want to reboot my workstation just to use it.  The Quiver
also mentioned 8BitWorkshop's
<A HREF="https://8bitworkshop.com/dithertron/#sys=msx">Dithertron</A> which is
a web browser tool that similarly dithers and tweaks to get a photo looking
good.  Let's try that.

<P>Dithertron outputs a binary file with just the pattern and colour data.  I
adapted DJ Sures' Brick Battle LoadImage() function to work with that format
(and added error checking).  It uses RetroNET-FileStore.h and files in a
directory of the server computer, which should be faster to download rather
than going through CP/M, and they don't get mangled by the Z88DK CP/M/stdio
glue code that tries to interpret binary as text.  After a few syntax errors,
and upside down shredded pictures, I got it to work!

<H3>Malloc Memory Allocation - need a Heap!</H3>

<P>I did another image loader for ICVGM's screen dump files.  They're ASCII
assembler hex data statements, which we just convert to binary on the fly.  One
complication is that it's for mode 1 graphics, which needs the tile font and
colours to be triplicated from 2K to 6K for mode 2.  For efficiency, I want to
read in that 2K of binary data into a buffer then write it to video memory
three times (rather than rewinding and processing the source file 3 times).
But I don't want to have a static 2K buffer sitting around unused most of the
time.

<P>So I'll allocate a 2K buffer from general memory, using malloc() and then
free() (from malloc.h) it when done.  However, that requires a heap to be
initialised, specifying all memory between the end of the program and the start
of the operating system code as usable by the heap.  Turns out you can manually
do it by setting up a global "_heap" variable, but there are a bunch of Z88DK
special statements to do it different ways.  I settled on
<CODE>#pragma define CRT_STACK_SIZE=1024</CODE> which leaves the specified
amount of memory available to the stack (and thus local variables inside
function calls), and uses the rest for the heap.   Hmmm, only 21K free, why is
the program already so big?  Oh, right, I already have static arrays for tile
data.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2024.12.11"></A>2024.12.11</H2>

<H3>Tiles now Displayed!</H3>

<P>After a couple of full days of coding, I got tiles to display, with
animation!

<P>There's an array of tiles, with information about each one - such as what
kind of tile it is (which player owns it, or is it a power-up tile), animation
state and some cached data (VDP address it uses, dirty flag, and play-area
coordinates for physics calculations).  The tile area can be bigger than the
screen - there's a scrollable window to display a smaller area of tiles.

<P>As part of the update, all tiles have their animation recalculated (currently
just cycles through a string of letters or special characters in the font),
which means a pair of loops going through all tiles then finding the character
to display for each one.  Then for the Video Display Processor update (triggered
by an interrupt), just the changed tiles are copied to the video memory.  Again
it's a loop over all tiles to find the ones marked dirty.

<P>I get the idea that we can't loop over all tiles.  So I'll have to mark dirty
ones by keeping a separate small list of tiles which need updating (and another
list of ones which have animations), and only update those ones.  The CPU is so
slow that I suspect I'll have to have at most a dozen in that list!  So, fast
moving balls changing lots of tiles may be difficult.

<H3>Weird Bugs prompt First Assembler Code</H3>

<P>I'm getting some oddities happening, and a crash on exit.  I was thinking it
may be from writing to a NULL pointer, trashing memory at location zero, where
the CP/M parameters and a few entry points are.  But that didn't seem to be the
problem, when the display updates but code like the frame counter doesn't run,
and shows a non-changing number rather than counting up from zero.  Which makes
me wonder if the stack frame has gone past the end of the stack.

<P>So I had to write some assembler to get the stack pointer and see if it was
above $FF00 (the small area past the interrupt table that Cloud CP/M uses for
the stack) or inside my much larger stack somewhere else in memory.
<PRE>
static uint16_t sStackFramePointer = 0;
static uint16_t sStackPointer = 0;
...
  __asm
  push af;
  push hl;
  ld hl,0
  add hl, sp; /* No actual move sp to hl instruction, but can add it. */
  ld (_sStackPointer), hl;
  ld (_sStackFramePointer), ix;
  pop hl;
  pop af;
  __endasm;
  printf ("Stack pointer is $%X, frame $%X.\n",
    (int) sStackPointer, (int) sStackFramePointer);
</PRE>

<P>Nope, the stack looks fine, though the frame pointer register ix was $FF00,
while the stack was $CCD5.  But after adding some local variables, the frame
pointer was near the stack as it should be.

<P>Maybe the mystery crash was because I had main() returning an int, rather
than void?  Yes, making main() return void fixed the crash at exit.

<P>More mysteries, <CODE>printf("$%X $$$$$%X", a, b)</CODE> loses the $
character (or even more $$$$ ones) before the second %X (for printing
hexadecimal numbers in upper case).  I had to work around it by doing
<CODE>printf("$%X %c%X", a, '$', b)</CODE>.  Was it mangling the stack when
doing that?

<P>One other tip, I can use printf to find problems, by redirecting CP/M text
output to a telnet server (doesn't mess up the VDP graphics memory when
outputting to the serial port + network).  It also lets you see stuff that
would otherwise scroll off the top of the CP/M screen, and in 80 columns.  Uses
the <CODE>STAT CON:=UC1:</CODE> and <CODE>STAT RDR:=UR1:</CODE> commands (in
that order) to redirect CP/M output and input to a remote telnet session.  On
second thought, the system hangs (doesn't switch back to text mode, who knows
what input device it is trying to listen to) after the program if you have RDR:
redirected, so only use the CON: one.  You can set it back to the screen with
<CODE>STAT CON:=CRT:</CODE>.

<H3>Faster Tiles, Less Crashing</H3>

<P>After fixing some bugs and switching to using a cache for updating only
tiles which are both on screen and have animation, it's starting to work
better.  Still have to speed things up more by making a cache listing dirty
tiles that need drawing, rather than scanning the whole array of tiles to look
for dirty flags.

<P>Along the way, I found out that the most reliable way to exit back to CP/M
is with a jump to location zero, assuming you haven't trashed it with a NULL
pointer.  A plain return at the end of the program only sometimes works.

<P>I also tried the DEBUG_VDP_INT option in NABU_LIB, which flashes the Alert
light when you miss a frame.  It has a logic bug and leaves the light on all
the time!  To fix it, add a <CODE>vdpIsReady = false;</CODE> right after your
call to vdp_waitVDPReadyInt(), because that function forgets to reset the flag
after waiting.

<H3>Even Faster Tiles!</H3>

<P>Today I implemented the dirty tile cache, so now it only processes tiles
that need drawing, until the cache overflows and we go back to the old slow
full screen scan technique.  It can support up to about 30 animated tiles
before running over the 60hz frame update time.  Since those will be used for
power-ups, we can design it to not have that many of them.  Though we'll need
CPU time to calculate the ball movements and physics, so the final limit will
be smaller.  Perhaps aim for 8 power ups active at any time?

Video of faster tile animations.  The "ding" sound is whenever it doesn't have
enough time to complete a full update at a 60 updates per second.  The
animations are power-ups, spelling out Slow, Fast, Through, Normal.  Though in
the final game, they'll be iconical graphics rather than letter sequences.

<H3>Now with Sprites!</H3>

<P>Got the basic player code and sprites animation system in today.  For the
longest time I was stumped when it wouldn't animate.  Turns out you need to
specify the pattern name in multiples of 4 since I was using 16x16 sprites, not
8x8.  There's also coordinate conversion from fractions to hardware pixels,
which can be weird (might be designed to be off by 1, also has a flag to shift
things left by 32 pixels so you can go over 256 in a byte).  May not be perfect,
but it works, with ball, shadow and power-up layers.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="FirstSprites20241220.GIF" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="216"
ALT="[Video of Sprites Moving for the First Time!]">

<P>Three days later, I added keyboard inputs to manually move sprites around
and check that the coordinate conversion from player to screen to VDP works.
The sprites now hit the edge at the right time, and can go past the screen edge
to be off screen (useful when the board is bigger than the screen display).
Turns out the VDP top of screen for sprites is -1, not zero in the Y
coordinate.

<P>I also added a variable offset for the shadow sprite.  You can move the
shadow away from the ball to show that the ball is flying above the board.
I'll have to come up with some power-up ideas to use that.

<P>Now that player drawing is working, next up is the physics simulation.

<H3>Physics in Small Steps</H3>

<P>After a night of sleeping on it, I've come up with an approach that should
let slow and fast balls collide semi-accurately with tiles and other balls,
with out too much slow math.  Better write it down before I wake up!

<P>Balls have a position in play area coordinates (pixels basically, can be
bigger than the screen), and a velocity in pixels per frame (a fixed point
fraction, 2 byte integer part, 2 byte fraction - though that may go down to 1
byte fraction for speed if I have time to write some math routines in
assembler).  Each frame, the ball moves forward the distance and direction
specified by the velocity by adding the velocity to the position, unless it
hits something.  However, I want balls to move both slower than 1 and faster
than 1 pixel per frame.  The hard part is going faster than a tile or ball
width in pixels - I don't want to skip over tiles and other balls while zipping
along.

<P>Some pinball games do it by running the physics at some multiple of the
frame rate, though most stop at 60 hz.  <A
HREF="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showtopic=27416&page=1">Virtual
Pinball</A> decouples physics from frame rate and can run it much faster, with
the caveat that each physics step should take the same amount of time for
consistency.  Andreas Axelsson of <A
HREF="https://www.lemonamiga.com/interviews/andreas_axelsson/">Pinball
Dreams/Fantasies/Illusions</A> fame has <A
HREF="https://gamedev.net/forums/topic/55242-pinball/">some tips on
collisions</A> - using a ball bitmap with collision angles embedded, and again
physics running faster than the frame rate.

<P>The Nabu doesn't have the CPU horsepower to do multiple physics updates per
frame all the time, so I'm going to use smaller updates steps only when needed.
The number of updates is related to the fastest ball's speed - each step should
advance the ball by at most 1 tile in X or Y (8 pixels in our case).  If there
are slight rounding errors causing missed tiles, I may have to cut it down to
0.5 tile width per step.  Since we don't want to do division, find the number
of right shifts that reduce the fastest ball's fastest velocity coordinate to
less than 1 tile, then do that shifting on all ball velocities to get the per
step velocity for each ball.  We will be doing 2**(number of shifts) steps, at
minimum 0 shifts, at most 7 shifts, corresponding to 1 to 128 steps (if a ball
is moving faster than 128 tiles per frame, some collisions will be missed, but
that is a ridiculously fast speed for a screen that is 32 tiles wide).  All the
balls will be updated with that number of steps and updated in parallel, so
that balls crossing paths will collide at the right spot.

<P>Each step, add the step velocity to the ball position to get the new
position for that step.  Check tiles around that new position for collisions -
have to check the tile the ball is on and the 3 adjacent tiles in the quadrant
nearest the new position to see if their distance from tile center to ball
center is less than (tile radius + ball radius).  Once all balls are updated
for the step, check for collisions between balls using centers and ball radii.

<P>When a collision happens, reflect the ball velocity and ball's step
velocity.  Maybe reduce or increase the ball velocity (but not the step
velocity - too messy) for inelastic or explosive collisions.

<H3>Faster Fixed Point Math in Z80 Assembler - "I had no option"</H3>

<P>After a week or so over the holidays writing physics code implementing the
previous post's ideas, it was almost working and horribly slow.  I had a look
at the code the C compiler generated, and was annoyed to see that most of it
was moving data around in temporary copies of the 32 bit numbers on the stack.
Pages and pages of <CODE>ld a,(ix+5); ld (ix+9),a</CODE> slowing math down.
Rearranging the fixed point macros to be function calls taking a pointer
argument fixed some of that.  But in the end I started writing my own 32 bit
math routines for the most important functions.

<P>A Negate(*X) and Compare(*X, *Y) function were the first, with some stumbles
figuring out how arguments were passed on the stack.  Then some juggling of
code to do a two pointer 32 bit subtraction.  It turns out the only SBC
(subtract a byte with carry) opcode which takes a pointer, uses the HL
register.  Yes, I spent quite a bit of time using the searchable Z80 opcode
chart at <A HREF="https://clrhome.org/table/">https://clrhome.org/table/</A> to
find the available instructions (also found a circa 2016 Z80 manual from Zilog,
and I have my Osborne &amp; Associates <CITE>Z80 Assembly Language
Programming</CITE> book from 1979).  That HL requirement triggered a bit of
shuffling around of code when getting the parameters off the stack (using the
HL register to walk the back-stack), to ensure the Y pointer ended up in HL.
Yet again, a unique opcode exchanges DE and HL, no other choices exist, so to
quote John Turner, "<A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_had_an_option,_sir">I had no
option</A>" but to use that to set up HL.  Then there was a bit of rewriting
when the Compare() results were wrong, because I forgot the number was signed,
and a borrow at the end of the comparison didn't mean anything.  Instead, there
is an overflow flag, and the only instruction that reads the overflow flag, is
<CODE>jp po,dest</CODE>.  Yet another case of no option, the theme for this
coding session.

<P>Anyway, I got 4 players bouncing off walls around the screen, though with
very little CPU time available (more than half a dozen power-ups puts it over
the edge of 60hz updates).  I wonder if checking tiles for collisions with the
balls will be too much, might have to go to 30 frames per second.  Time for
writing some more assembler code and looking at compiler assembly output for
other slowdowns.

<H3>Comparing Compiler and Assembler</H3>

<P>Matthew E. on Facebook asked to see some of the assembly code, so here's a
comparison of what the compiler makes and some code I wrote.  It's a lot better
than it used to be now that it uses pointers rather than a macro like this:<BR>
<CODE>#define COMPARE_FX(A, B) ((A < B) ? -1 : ((A == B) ? 0 : 1))</CODE>

<P>Here's the original source code:

<PRE>
/* Compare two values X & Y, return a small integer (so it can be returned in
   a register rather than on the stack) which is -1 if X < Y, zero if X = Y,
   +1 if X > Y. */
int8_t COMPARE_FX(pfx x, pfx y)
{
#ifdef NABU_H
  x; /* Just avoid warning about unused argument, doesn't add any opcodes. */
  y;
  __asm
  ld    hl,2      /* Hop over return address. */
  add   hl,sp     /* Get pointer to argument x, will put in bc. */
  ld    c,(hl)

  if (x->as_int32 < y->as_int32)
    return -1;
  else if (x->as_int32 == y->as_int32)
    return 0;
  return 1;
#endif
}
</PRE>

<P>And here is a comparison of what the code looks like after compiling, so
you can see opcodes and code size.  The C compiler is SDCC patched for Z88DK,
version 4.4.0, #14648.  The compiler command line Z88DK generates is
<CODE>z88dk-zsdcc --constseg rodata_compiler -mz80 --no-optsdcc-in-asm --c1mode
--emit-externs --no-c-code-in-asm --opt-code-speed --no-peep --peep-file
...files...</CODE> (most noticably --opt-code-speed sets up frame pointer ix
directly, if you optimise for size it calls a subroutine for that, and there
are presumably other speed optimisations in the generated code).

<P>By the way, the big improvement is using --max-allocs-per-node200000 (yes,
no space or equals sign, default is 2000, improves register assignment and
smartness of the compiler), which cuts code size by about 6% and presumably
makes it faster, but balloons compile time to several minutes.

<P>That makes me wonder if it would be better to test for zero before looking
at the signs.  Nice to see that the C version does handle overflows in the
comparison, rather than just looking at the high bit of the result of a virtual
subtraction.

<H3>Tile Collisions</H3>

<P>I got the first attempt at doing tile collisions working today.  It takes
into account the tile and ball width, which is why it makes trails of two tiles
wide when a ball moves.  I think it would look better if it was only one tile
wide, and the game would last longer.

<P>Also, it picks the side of the tile to bounce off by looking for the largest
velocity component.  That means that it pretty much always goes in one
direction.  I'll have to rethink bouncing.  The trouble is that I want
something that doesn't do anything more complex than subtraction, so no vector
dot products.

<P>Obviously a bit of rethinking needed here.  Also, the frame rate has dropped
to 30 frames per second, or even less if balls are moving super fast (more
physics steps for that so that each step is one tile at most).  Fortunately
there aren't too many more CPU draining features to add to the game.  Well,
except for networking?

<H3>Better Visible Colours, Rethinking Tile Collisions</H3>

<P>First, and simplest, I need to change the colours so that the players show
up on the screen!  They're usually moving over tiles of their own colour.  So
change tiles to use the darker tint of the player colour, and make the ball
shadow black.

<A HREF="TileColoursBounce20250114.mp4">TileColoursBounce20250114.mp4</A> video
with sound.

<P>Next time, redo collisions - I want the ball trails to be narrower (the wide
trail could be a power up?), and the bounces to be a bit more varied in
direction.  The
<A HREF="https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars/blob/main/index.html">Koen van
Gilst code</A> doesn't consider ball and tile widths as much, but tests in a
circle (half a square in radius) around the ball's position (in 45 degree
increments) for tiles that aren't owned by the player.  Then use the angle
tested to pick the side of the tile to bounce off - comparing cos and sin and
using the larger one (so the more head-on side of the tile is used for
bouncing).  All tiles in the circle are tested, so there could be several
bounces.  And then there's a velocity randomness function that changes ball
speed up or down by at most 1% every frame, bounded by minimum and maximum
speeds.  Interesting inspiration, but I'll have to think about how to do
something similar without sin, cos, multiply, divide and so on.

<H2><A NAME="2025.01.19"></A>2025.01.19</H2>

<H3>Better Bounces</H3>

<P>Adjusted the bounces to be a bit better.  Now it evaluates all tiles nearby,
ORs together the results then checks for a bounce needed in X and/or Y.  Before
it would do a bounce for each tile collision as it checked, which could have
several bounces in the same direction, resulting in the ball going through
tiles if it was at the right diagonal angle.

<P>I'm also starting on the scoring system.  One idea is that for extra points,
if your tile lasts long enough, and you hit it again, it can become more mature
and give you extra points (and change its shape).  I'm also thinking of having
score bubbles float up as you get points, using low priority sprites.

<H3>Head Banging Bugs with itoa()</H3>

<P>I was trying to display scores, which means converting a number into text,
then drawing the text on the screen.  I had a nice separate DrawScore()
function, except it kept on crashing the computer quite badly.

<P>After an afternoon of debugging with printf()s to a telnet session (so it
doesn't mess up the Nabu's screen), I found that my local variables were
changed after a call to utoa() - a system provided function to convert an
unsigned number to ASCII text string.  The more commonly used itoa() -
integer number to string - also malfunctions the same way.  What is going on?
Also, my head figuratively hurts after an afternoon of banging against a wall
to find out what the problem was.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="PrintfDebugging20250121.png"
ALT="[Screen shot of printf() debugging to find out where corruption happens]"
WIDTH="489" HEIGHT="428">

<P>Turns out the Z88DK/SDCC library code for stdlib.h (which includes itoa() and
other variations) eventually calls an assembler function in asm_utoa.asm which
uses all the usual registers, plus ix, plus alternate register sets.  And ix is
used for keeping track of the local variables when compiling for speed, one of
those locals is a pointer to the score text buffer (so the score gets written
to somewhere unexpected in memory - crash!).  That could be it, and explain
other mysterious things that were happening in previous versions of my program
(I was using utoa() to display the frame number).

<P>A day later, I ended up replacing the general purpose utoa() with another
simpler one I found in l_fast_utoa.asm that only does base 10, and doesn't use
as many registers.  After writing a bit of C glue in assembler, it works!  So
two days later I can get back to displaying scores.

<P>Looking under the hood, the utoa() operations are expensive (divides
by a power of ten for each digit), so I'll have to avoid converting scores
if they haven't changed since the last frame.

<P>And a few hours later, the score is starting to work!

<H3>Driving Around versus Thrusting</H3>

<P>The conventional version of this type of game (because it is easily
implemented) drives the players around like objects in outer space.  Great if
you're making a Lunar Lander game, with joystick controlled rocket acceleration
and friction free space drifting.  I'd prefer to have a bit of steering, like
you do with a car, with more direct control since it's less frustrating.  The
big rule is that you can change direction, and the velocity stays the same.
But how to rotate a velocity vector to simulate steering when you have to
avoid multiplication / division / square roots for speed?

<P>If you go very fast, there should also be a bit of friction to slow you
down.  Otherwise the game will slow down when it has to run extra physics steps
to accurately track the player speed!  I'm not sure if the friction should stop
at some slower velocity, or if the players always have to thrust to move.

<P>Actually, I'd like to keep the rocket thrust experience for the fire button
and use a nifty scoring trick I thought of.  Hold the button down and move the
joystick in a direction and it will use up tiles of your own colour to power
your acceleration (tiles disappear, speed increases).  For extra fun, we can
have partial tiles which get converted to fuller tiles every time you drift
over them (there's so much time spent doing that, might as well make it
meaningful), and the fuller tiles will give more thrust when harvested.  No
need to keep track of the order of tiles encountered or age of tiles, just
burn the tiles you are currently colliding with (adds a bit of gameplay to
seek linear streaks of your colour for higher speeds).  If you don't specify
a direction while holding down the button, the thrust will be in a direction
to slow you down.

<P>In general, power-ups will be passive objects, not something you have to
control (no more buttons left, and it would make things too complex for the
casual user).  You just collide with the power-up to start it.  They may affect
your speed, your width (hit more tiles), and maybe even height above ground
(skip over tiles).  They should all time out after a certain amount of use.

<H3>Joystick Control</H3>

<P>Got player control working for the first time, hooking up the joystick
directions to add to the velocity.  Yes, that's the floaty thrust type game
mechanic, but it did do for testing the automatic assignment of joysticks to
players when joystick activity is detected.  Also, with too much thrust, you
bounce off the walls quite a lot!

<H2><A NAME="2025.01.28"></A>2025.01.28</H2>

<H3>Rotating Manhattan Velocity Vectors</H3>

<P>Continuing on with the rotation without doing multiplication (let alone
matrix multiplication by cosines and sines - the conventional way of doing
rotation), I have an approach that may work.  The key idea is that in true
vector rotations, the length of the vector stays the same, just the angle
changes.  Avoiding square roots and such, we can approximate it by doing
Manhattan distances (distances along city blocks, where you can't go
diagonally), so rather than the usual length = sqrt(x*x + y*y), I'd like to
try abs(x) + abs(y) = Manhattan length, using absolute values rather than
squares and square roots.  It wouldn't look as smooth as real vector length
(diagonal movement would be faster), but it may work well enough for a game.

<P>To use it, Manhattan rotation would increase X and simultaneously decrease Y
by the same amount (or vice versa, so that the Manhattan length doesn't change),
though we're actually using absolute values so increasing X could be in the
positive direction or if it was negative, increasing would be in the negative
direction.  Same double direction possibilities for Y.  The amount to take off
Y and add to X should be large enough to be visible but small enough that it
takes a while to rotate in a full circle (actually a full square since it is
Manhattan).  If it's a constant, then it will take longer to turn at higher
speeds, otherwise the delta value would need to be related to the speed to do
turns in constant time.

<P>That doesn't actually work, unless you're already heading to the right
(increasing X).  Also to get to positive X if you start at negative X, you have
to head to zero X first, then to positive X.  Indeed, for each 45 degree
direction, you have to maximize or minimize or zero each coordinate differently.
So to keep it organised, I'm going to use angles from 0 to 7, each one being 45
degrees, with zero heading right and increasing angles clockwise (the screen Y
coordinate increases downwards, X to the rightwards, not quite the same as the
usual X-Y Cartesian axis where angles increase counter-clockwise).  Conveniently
when moving from one quadrant to the next, only one of the axis goals changes,
so the rotation moves without glitching too much.  The goal for each axis is
one of: make as negative as possible, move towards zero, make positive.  If
both X and Y goals are making them as large as possible, the goal should be to
make them equal.

<P>Will it work at all?  Will Manhattan velocity rotation feel good in the
game when driving your dot around the screen?  The easiest way to see is
to write the code.  Tune in next time, to find out if this square idea works.

<H3>Argh!  Equals signs!</H3>

<P>After lots of wondering why the steering wasn't doing much other than making
the ball go left and right, I added lots of printfs to print out intermediate
values, ran out of memory, then hacked up the NABU-LIB library to not have a 2K
full screen text buffer (we're not using the redundant text refresh
functionality, which Cloud CP/M already has built-in).  Finally I could add yet
more printfs and continue debugging.

<P>The printfs narrowed it down to a few lines, where I found the classic
mistake of using == instead of = to assign a value.  In this case it was the
angle (octant) to turn towards remaining at the default zero, which means
rightwards.  It's working better on first run, but needs some edge case testing
and I need a good night's sleep.

<H3>Exactly Equal Diagonal Steering</H3>

<P>One last niggle was to get steering working on diagonals. When moving the
joystick to the diagonal, it would often steer by alternating horizontal and
then vertical moves, rather than truly going diagonal.

<P>The Manhattan Vector Rotation subtracts a number (1.0 if moving fast, or the
difference between X and Y if that is less than 1.0) from one axis and adds it
to the other axis of the vector.  That's fine for horizontal or vertical
(turning right for example, reduces Y and increases X by the same small amount,
repeat until Y is 0 then you are going exactly rightwards), but for diagonals
it overshoots.

<P>To be exactly on the diagonal octants we need |X| == |Y|, so the amount to
move between X and Y should be the difference (|X| - |Y|) divided by two, rather
than the whole difference.  But if we just add/subtract the half difference
from both X and Y, we don't always get |X| == |Y| due to the half distance being
rounded off by a least significant bit in the fraction (that messes up the turn,
which fails to proceed from octant angle to adjacent octant, if it never gets
exactly on the octant).  The work-around is to calculate the larger of X or Y
to be on the diagonal and then copy (and maybe negate if needed) the value to
Y or X.  That UW course on numerical computation (rounding errors and all that)
paid off!

Script <A HREF="Steering20250220.txt">Steering20250220.txt</A> about steering.

<P>Steering works nicely, with sharp turns when going slow and slower larger
turns when going fast.  It does change the game-play, since now you can target
squares and bounce around them, while previously with thrusting, you'd bounce
off and it would take a while (Lunar Lander style) to use thrust to turn
around.  Anyway, I'll make thrust rarer, getting thrust via power ups or
hitting your own tiles (consuming them).  The rest of the time you'll gradually
slow down to a speed limit (carefully set to avoid doing extra physics updates
for fast objects) and can just cruise around at that slower speed, steering
easily.

<P>Now that we have velocity angles for the players, should I have the sprites
be directional (need a pointy end) and point in the direction of movement?

<H3>Tile Power</H3>

<P>For a bit of fun (unlike perfecting vector math details which takes ages
to pay off), add power to the tiles.

<P>The idea is that when you hold down the thrust button, rather than having
free thrust, it gets power from consuming the tiles you run into, if they're
your tiles.  If you run into a tile without trying to thrust, it turns into your
colour, then on subsequent collisions gets more solidly your colour over
several stages of colourfulness.  Then when you harvest that tile by thrusting,
you get more thrust if it is a more solid colour.  So bouncing backwards and
forwards over the same area no longer seems like a waste of time - you're
enriching your tiles.

that age and can be harvested for thrust.

<P>Notice the green player.  They are alternating harvesting with growing their
tiles to move up and down faster and faster.  As a bit of feedback, when thrust
is harvested the power-up graphic around the player spins.  If you're harvesting
and not getting much, it doesn't spin.

<P>This version uses thrusting in the joystick direction when harvesting tiles.
That's a bit too complex, and if you're not paying attention, you lose speed if
you are pointing in the wrong direction.  So I should make the harvest
acceleration go in the same direction the player is currently pointing in (we
have an angle octant!).  But that's something for next time.

<H3>Thrust while Steering</H3>

<P>I changed the thrust to be in the direction the player is already going,
which makes the game a lot more nicer to play.  Also adjusted the tile aging
speed so you can see all the tile animations, and fixed a few leftover
non-empty tile problems when harvesting.

<H3>Sound Tests</H3>

<P>It's time to look at (listen to?) sound effects.  I'm currently using NabuLib
code for playing pure notes, though I discovered that it only plays one note at
a time, shutting down all other channels when it starts a new note, though
that's likely because it's using the envelope feature which is shared between
all channels.

<P>I also wanted to look at some other examples, since I'm not familiar with the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Instrument_AY-3-8910">AY-3-8910</A>
sound making chip.  I decided to have a look at Leo Binkowski's assembler code
for Pacman; conveniently most of the sound effects are in <A
HREF="https://github.com/LeoBinkowski/NABU/blob/main/nabu-pacman/PACSOUND.MAC">PACSOUND.MAC</A>.

narration.<BR>
Short script <A HREF="SoundTests20250304.txt">SoundTests20250304.txt</A>.

<P>In particular, the wacka-wacka sound of Pacman moving was my starting point,
with the relevant code mostly near the WACKA: label.  I converted it from
assembler spaghetti to C spaghetti in the Wacka() function in my test
<A HREF="https://github.com/agmsmith/NthPongWars/blob/main/Hello/main.c">Hello
program</A>.  There was one oddity, he writes different frequency values to the
sound chip twice.  I thought that the second write mere microseconds after the
first one would overwrite it, and did some tests to confirm that it sounds the
same without the first write.  I wondered if it was leftover code, and added a
delay to hear the two frequencies, and it does indeed sound different.  Checking
the actual Nabu Pacman, it sounds like the simple version of the sound, so they
probably used the listed code, wasting time doing calculations with an inaudible
write to the frequency register.

<P>The takeaway from that is you can use the 60hz interrupt to change the sound
and make it more interesting than a plain tone.  Still, I'd like to see what you
can do with just the noise and envelope features of the chip (I see AlphaBlast
and Miner 2049er do use the noise register).  Maybe I can get away without doing
sound modification on the fly and save on CPU power.  I just need bounces off
the walls, tile getting and consuming sounds, and collision sounds.

<P>One trick may be to have a background sound like Pacman (a subtle whoo-whoo),
not quite music, which would be a bit of work to set up, but better than
nothing.  Thanks to Leo, I can steal from the best!

<H3>Looking into Music</H3>

<P>Can we do background music with sound effects while the game is running?
Something better than the ambient siren noises of Pacman.

<P>There are several music players available for the AY-8910 sound chip.
Z88DK includes WYZ Player and Vortex Tracker (plays ProTracker PT3 files, and
other formats) for the Nabu platform.  WYZ looks better since it can do sound
effects as well as music.  But how to make the music?  There was little
documentation for XYZ, except comments in Spanish in the WYZ player code and
a .mus file extension, no idea of how you create those files.  Vortex has a
<A HREF="https://bulba.untergrund.net/vortex_e.htm">Vortex Tracker II page</A>
which does have copious docs in the download, a web site programmer's page with
source code and file formats, and includes a Windows music editor executable,
though you could also use ProTracker3.

<P>I also found a smaller editor and player called
<A HREF="http://cngsoft.no-ip.org/chipnsfx.htm">CHIPNSFX</A>.  It includes
source code for the editor, so I can compile it for Linux or Windows.  I'll
give that a shot first.  Just had to install SDL2 and compiling for Linux was
then straight forward after telling the compiler to stop complaining about
coding style.

<P>Ah ha, CHIPNSFX has documentation on how to use the Tracker and the Player
in a .txt file, hidden amongst hundreds of example music files.  Sound effect
mode is essentially a second song which overrides the music song when it is
making noise.  You can also set individual channels (of the 3 hardware channels)
to play a particular tune block, which would be good for triggering sound
effects.

<H3><A NAME="2025.03.16"></A>2025.03.16</H3>

<P>Continuing on, it looks like the Z88DK assembler can understand the macros
(lots of "if" statements for conditional assembly for all sorts of options).
Will try to get it to assemble the Player.  Had to write the writepsg()
function to set sound chip registers on the Nabu, with a special case for
register 7 which controls dangerous IO ports on the AY chip as well as sound
related functionality.  It assembles!  Now I need to create some music files.

<H3><A NAME="2025.03.18"></A>2025.03.18</H3>

<P>Figured out how to use the Tracker and make music.  Got the player code to
assemble, but the link fails with a cryptic <CODE>type != TYPE_COMPUTED</CODE>
assert, without saying where it is or what symbols are involved.  May have to
hack the assembler to print more details in that situation.  Found the
assertion in z88dk/src/z80asm/src/c/expr1.c, where it wants to convert a
TYPE_COMPUTED into a constant, and fails since the other parts of the
expression have a TYPE_COMPUTED value.  Ugh.

<H3><A NAME="2025.03.19"></A>2025.03.19</H3>

<P>I hacked up the z88dk-z80asm code for expression parsing to print out the
file and line where the expression was, and found it to be lines that look like
<CODE>chip_addnoise = $-1-chip_base+chipnsfx</CODE>.  Since we're not making a
ROM version, chip_base == chipnsfx and simplifying the line to
<CODE>chip_addnoise = $-1</CODE> gets it past the assembler, at the cost of
breaking ROM compile functionality.  Whew!  By the way, if you remove the
assert, it generates bad code for that expression.

One of the included music scores was the sound track to Square Roots, by
"tometjerry" in demo group Vanity, a
<A HREF="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=85287">demo for the Amstrad CPC</A>.
Here's what it sounds like in the included player (likely too fast, 60hz vs
50hz in Europe).

<H3>Adding Music and Sound Effects to the Game Code</H3>

<P>After a daunting delay to compose music (new topic for me), I gave up and
just put in an alternating scales run with some percussion and concentrated on
getting the code in the game.

<P>It was fairly straight forward.  I ripped out the old PlayNote code and
changed it to triggering CHIPNSFX tracks.  Now an effect can be a fancy noise
sequence or even music.  I added a priority scheme where higher priority sound
effects bump lower priority ones, with separation of the sounds that use the
solitary white noise generator (only one channel of the three can make noise).
I did run into a bug where the player stops playing the background music
channel 0 if a sound effect plays on channel 0.  The other two channels work
properly - going back to the music after playing a sound effect.  I just
changed the music to only use channels 1 and 2.

<P>After a bit of fine tuning, and changing steering to be sharper, this is
the current state of the game.  The main game-play mechanic that you can control
seems to be colouring in the board.  Fine control isn't easy at that speed, but
you can generally get colour to a desired area of the board.  Plus there's the
dynamic of harvesting tiles for extra speed, which has a positive feedback loop
(you move faster and colour more tiles so you can harvest more and go yet
faster).

<H3>Power-up Ideas</H3>

<P>Now that I have an idea of what the game does, it's time to collect power-up
ideas that can be implemented easily.  Can you have several at once?  Would have
to show them as a sequence of power-up animations.  Do they expire after a set
time, is the time remaining shown in the animation?  Do the power-ups on the
board self destruct after a while and reappear elsewhere?

<UL>
  <LI>Fat ball - bounces off and leaves a wider streak of tiles, just do a
      wider collision with tiles detection.
  <LI>Sharper turning radius - very nice to have.  Affects vector rotation
      calculation.
  <LI>Extra speed.  Not needed since we harvest tiles for speed now.
  <LI>Stop dead.  Kills your velocity, something to avoid.
  <LI>Higher Speed Limit - air resistance kicks in above speed X, this power-up
      raises that limit.  Display as a higher height above the board with
      shadow offset increased.  Offset decreases over time until you're back
      to normal.
  <LI>Debouncer - go through tiles rather than bouncing off them.

<H3>AI Players</H3>

<P>Taxes are finally done, now I have a few moments to think about AI players
before cottage maintenance season starts and I run out of time again.  I want
AI players to help me figure out the game-play, as well as eventually for
keeping Human players amused.

<P>The key functionality is to have an AI player head towards a specific spot
on the screen.  On top of that you can build all sorts of behaviours - from
players that follow a route around the screen (useful for spelling out the
title in tile trails), to ones that chase other players, to ones which go for
concentrations of other player's tiles.

<P>How do you head for a spot?  You subtract the player position from the
target position to get a direction vector.  Then convert that direction into an
octant angle which is used to adjust the steering.  Also use the Manhattan
length of the direction vector to control the speed, slowing down as you get
near.  Or rather, since we don't have brakes, just don't speed up if you are
near the target.  For more subtlety, we can compute a desired velocity and try
to maintain it.  Also we can tweak the desired velocity by a difficulty or AI
personality factor, so some AIs will be slower than others and some will be too
fast and tend to overshoot.  To avoid using too much CPU, only update the AI
every 4 frames (max 4 AIs, only one gets an update every frame), so typically
1/5 of a second between updates where the AI holds the current steering
direction and harvest mode.

<P>There will also be a bit of speed control.  If the AI needs to speed up, it
should alternate between harvesting and laying down tiles.  It could reverse,
lay down tiles, then go towards the target again while harvesting.  Or perhaps
do little circles, alternating laying down tiles and harvesting, then heading
back to its target when it has enough speed.

<H3>Recompiling MAME 0.270 for Fedora 39</H3>

<P>Back at the cottage, after getting the old PC to work semi-reliably (PCIe
bus errors while accessing the video card (cleaned out spiders from slots), and
virtual machine operations crash it hard too (failing CPU)), I tried to get my
development environment working.

<P>I had copied Z88DK from Fedora 41, and some missing libraries not in Fedora
39 broke the compiler.  Time to recompile.  Of course, MAME 0.271 also doesn't
work in Fedora 39 (NABU comm port simulation broken, doesn't work at any
speed), so I needed to go back to 0.270, which meant an hours long recompile
since the pre-built images didn't include that version (just 0.271 or 0.258
were available).  Fortunately the system was stable enough for those hours long
compiles to finish.  Guess that counts as a system burn in test too!

<P>The rain has stopped and the guests are gone, so it's time to mow the
somewhat overgrown spring lawn, before dandelions grow too tall and yet more
rain falls.  Hopefully more Nth Pong Wars later.

<H2><A NAME="2025.07.09"></A>2025.07.09</H2>

<H3>Getting Back to AI Players</H3>

<P>Got the speed control working, though it slowed down the frame rate just by
using fixed point 32 bit math taking the absolute values of velocity X and Y,
adding that (giving Manhattan speed), then comparing it with the desired speed.
I reworked it as 16 bit integers, ignoring fractions of pixels per frame, which
is good enough for practical use, and the frame rate is back!  You can actually
store the speed in 8 bits for use by the AI, since a speed of 255 pixels per
frame would cross the whole screen in one frame, and you don't need to simulate
that accurately, if it even happens.

<P>Building up speed is done by laying down and then eating tiles.  You can lay
down a long run, going back and forth to make more powerful tiles in your
colour, then harvest them.  But it turns out you can lay down and eat very
rapidly, just pulsing the fire button very frequently.  Is that a cheat or a
feature?  The drawback is that you don't leave behind very many tiles so your
score will be low.  I'll have to try out both methods in the AI, with some sort
of pulse rate and duty cycle.  Unfortunately there isn't enough CPU to look
ahead to see what tiles a player will encounter, unless we do something like
have the AIs stay on purely horizontal or vertical paths.

<P>Anyway, is this harvesting tiles for speed a good idea for gameplay, or
should I chuck it?  I'll have to play it to find out!

<H3>Better Harvest Sound Effects</H3>

<P>Just fiddling around with the music and sound effects.  For harvesting,
rather than interrupting a sound (or tune), make the sound short to start out
with.  I found out that you don't need a Rest note at the end, just the end of
song opcode quiets it, and that can make a 2 frame updates sound take 1 frame.
I also hack the sound data to change the pitch for the harvest noise based on
the player number, and added a bigger harvest has priority scheme.  So
harvesting now sounds better and is more meaningful.

<H3>Player on Player Collisions</H3>

<P>I finally got around to doing player colliding with player collision
detection.  The detection part was easy, the action afterwards was the tricky
part.  Sure, the physics just involves swapping velocities between the players
(momentum conservation, assuming they're all the same mass, and we ignore the
angle of collision and assume it is completely elastic).  I even had to write
some assembler code to speed up swapping fixed point values; the compiler
generated stuff was a large mess.  I did get to use the fancy ldir Z80 opcode
(copies a byte of data, increments two pointers, counts down until done, all in
one compact instruction), but found that four ldi instructions were faster than
one ldir instruction, because ldir reloads that one instruction for every byte
copied!  But afterwards, if the player balls haven't moved far enough, they
collide again and again and sometimes get stuck on each other.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20250724CollisionA.mp4"><IMG

ALT="[First attempt at collisions, they last too long]"></A><BR>
<A HREF="20250724CollisionA.mp4">20250724CollisionA.mp4</A>

<P>My first hack was to add a small amount of velocity to separate them on
every collision.  It usually works, after a few (sometimes many) more
collisions where it looks like they are fighting each other, one or both of
them will zoom away at high speed.  But that doesn't look very elegant.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20250724CollisionB.mp4"><IMG

ALT="[Second attempt at collisions, separation still delayed]"></A><BR>
<A HREF="20250724CollisionB.mp4">20250724CollisionB.mp4</A>

<P>The problem is that they are still laying down tiles of their own colour,
and the other collidee hits those tiles and bounces back towards the player,
setting up another collision.  So this time when there's a collision, for half
a second ignore further collisions and switch the players into harvest mode,
where they remove tiles and leave empty space.  That way they'll be able to
depart the scene of the collision.  It almost worked, but they sometimes were
moving too slowly and got stuck together (that velocity exchange over repeated
collisions synchronised them), so I reapplied the first velocity addition hack
and the collisions now don't last forever and look great!

<H3>More AI Behaviours</H3>

<P>Now that I have some simple AI code working, the players can follow
patterns and change behaviours.  They now follow a little program, with
just a few actions:

<UL>
  <LI>Head towards a particular tile.
  <LI>Head towards a corner of the board, each player has their own.
  <LI>Change speed, which affects their tile harvesting timing, with more rapid
    alternation between laying down tiles and harvesting them if it needs to go
    faster.  Or it can just drift in harvest mode, so it doesn't lay down any
    tiles.
  <LI>Head towards another player, usually the one with the highest score, or
    just the Human with highest score.
  <LI>Delay a while, hovering around the target if that was the last action.
  <LI>Goto a particular instruction.  No IF statements yet, though each player
    can start running code from a different instruction location.
</UL>

<P>Unfortnately due to lack of CPU power, it can only update each AI about 5
times per second.  So that kind of makes it fairer when playing against a Human
:-)

AIs each moving along its own side, with the blue player tracing out the
letter "N".  If a Human player appears, chase it down!

<P>Next up, possibly make power-ups do things.  They are generated
every few seconds to meet an overall quota, but currently only act
as things to bounce off of.

<P>Or perhaps make it take more effort to knock down the more solid tiles,
then you could build a defensive wall.  That's the advantage of adding AI
players - I can see how the larger game works, and get ideas like defensive
walls.

<H3>Adding Power-ups</H3>

<P>I spent a bit of time making graphics for the power-ups, trying to be
obvious in their meaning, but that's not easy.  I also coded the actions for
the power-ups, including a generic power-up timer array so you could have many
simultaneous power-ups running.  The power-ups are now these ones (unplayable
Fast was removed):
<OL>
  <LI><B>Stop</B>.  A hexagonal stop sign (can't do octagonal, not enough
    resolution).  Not animated, it's stopped!  It stops the player's motion
    when you hit it.  The player has to start laying down and harvesting tiles
    on the spot to get moving again.

  <LI><B>Wide</B>.  A pulsing ring (or diamond due to lack of resolution) which
    makes your player wider for a little while.  There's also a similar pulsing
    ring sprite around the player when the effect is active.  Wide makes the
    player lay down a wider track of tiles, and collide with more tiles.  A
    related power-up to consider implementing is <B>Solid</B>, for laying down
    solid tiles behind you.  No, I won't use an animated poop emoji for that!
    Hmmm, if you look online, that's a thing.  Though that does suggest a game
    re-skinning for a variation on cleaning up after pets...

  <LI><B>Normal</B>.  A slumping colour cycling mountain.  Deactivates all
    power-ups you currently have.  Maybe I should simplify things and combine
    it with Stop?

  <LI><B>Bash</B>.  A sideways pair of lines expanding, not the best graphic,
    got any ideas for 8x8 pixel animations with few colours?  There's a similar
    sprite animation around the player.  It makes you destroy an enemy tile
    with one bounce, useful for the more solid tiles which otherwise take more
    bounces to destroy.  Combine Wide and Bash and you can quickly wipe out
    another player's tiles.  Though we only have one sprite to show the
    power-up, so the more significant effect is shown (could use more sprites
    &amp; CPU time, or make combo graphics, if I have time to put it in).

  <LI><B>Fly</B>.  A pair of white wings flying upwards on a gray body,
    surrounded by a small blue cloud moving with the wings.  The blue cloud
    idea is that you can distinguish a splash of colour more quickly than a
    shape, so the power-ups should all have a distinctive easily visible colour
    area.  It makes the player fly.  When they are high enough, they no longer
    collide with the tiles (or lay them down) and also miss other players, so
    long as their height difference is big enough.  The shadow is moved away
    from the player to show the height, and changes colour (and blinks fast
    when close to tile height) when the player is above tile collision height.
    Though I'm thinking of leaving the shadow black and just changing the
    player's ball colour when they get above tile height.

<A HREF="20250903PowerUpGamePlay.txt">Script.txt</A> about what the power-ups are doing.

<P>Fly would be more useful to get to inaccessible areas of the board.  Which suggests the idea of walls.  Implemented as tiles that don't get destroyed.
Maybe also have indestructable power-ups to make designed levels with.  And
that suggests we need a way of loading levels, so you can progress from simple
ones which are all open to ones with enclosed areas.  And gotchas like new
power-up locations not spawning in a wall, since that would make a hole that
players could get through.

<P>So I need to come up with a file format for saving levels.  Likely a text
file of some sort for easy editing.  Maybe also have separate music for each
level, rather than compiling it into the code?  High scores for each level, and
a total score too.  Also need to implement end of level detection, winners,
score keeping, and lots of related stuff.  Maybe even a title screen!  I might
have to drop CP/M support (saves 10 kilobytes) and use NABU PAK segment files
to fit it all into memory.

through walls looked like a parrot rather than a fist, I stuck to abstract
shapes and am happy with the graphical look.  I added a solid trail power-up,

<P>Before I tackle level loading (had an idea for a scripting language so you
could load levels, test high scores, have bonus levels if you do well enough),
I'm going to have a look at running without CP/M in memory, to give a bit of
space for more things.  It does mean no standard output (no files) other than
what the NABU network adapter API can do, which is actually quite a lot.  So I
could have debug text going to a Telnet terminal session over TCP networking,
and read and write files on the server (game levels, high scores), with
subdirectories in the file names!

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2025.09.14"></A>2025.09.14</H2>

<H3>Compiling without the OS</H3>

<P>It turns out that merely removing all calls to printf() is enough for the
linker to not include standard I/O library functions.  Those won't work since
there isn't any terminal, or file system, when in non-OS mode.

<P>So surprisingly, using Z88DK to build a "nabu" target (rather than "cpm")
worked the first time!  I should neaten up the code, and add a debug print
system that goes over the network to a telnet terminal session, but it works!
The game plays just fine.  However, there are two problems:

<P>The "nabu" target dragged in some VDP library code and data, which that
target includes for convenience, but I'm using NABU-LIB which has the same
functionality so I'd rather not do that.

<P>As well, the "nabu" target builds code designed to run at address $140D,
which is where the stock Nabu 4K boot rom loads the first program.  So memory
space from $0 to $140D, about 5 kilobytes is wasted.  Also, only that boot ROM
loads code at that address, other ROM versions load somewhere around there, or
presumably after $2000 for the 8K ROMs.  Which makes me think I should add a
relocater in the setup code to move the program down to near the beginning of
memory.  I'll have to leave some space for the interrupt table ($FF00 to $FFFF
in NABU-LIB) and a stack.  After we have relocated things to where they were
compiled for, the C runtime runs and sets up the memory heap and other C
ecosystem things like the at-exit routines.

<P>So, is there a bare bones Z88DK target that won't add VDP library routines?
There are two, "embedded" which makes a system that assumes separate ROM and
RAM areas, and plain "z80" which doesn't include extra libraries (except a
console IO one) and just sets up the C ecosystem.  Looks like I should make a
new target and add the relocator to it.

<H3>New Nabu Bare Target for Z88DK - More memory!</H3>

<P>After a cottage closing delay, other chores and a car crash (car totalled,
fortunately only scraped my knee), I put in a new Nabu target subtype into the
Z88DK development system.  Most of the time was figuring out how the system
works, with annoying problems like two different ways of defining a symbol
for compiles and assembles.  Anyway, I was able to add a "bare" subtype which
doesn't include any IO functions (no stdio, no printing, no disk).  I also
added a bootstrap relocator to the C runtime, which figures out where the
program got loaded into memory by the NABU ROM and moves it to the correct
origin.  There were a few stumbles finding out the size of the program, and
using trampoline code (code written by the bootstrap to a known fixed high
memory location) to do the move.

<P>Have a look at <A HREF="https://github.com/agmsmith/z88dk/blob/nabu_bare/lib/target/nabu/classic/nabu_crt0.asm">https://github.com/agmsmith/z88dk/blob/nabu_bare/lib/target/nabu/classic/nabu_crt0.asm</A> to see the code.  The magic trick to find out where in memory you got loaded is (NABU_BARE_STUB_DESTINATION is $FFE0):
<PRE>
    ; Get the current program counter, where in memory are we?
    ld  hl, NABU_BARE_STUB_DESTINATION
    ld  (hl), $e1 ; pop hl opcode.
    inc hl
    ld  (hl), $e9 ; jp (hl) opcode.
    call NABU_BARE_STUB_DESTINATION ; Returns with program counter in HL.
nabu_bare_pc: ; HL points to nabu_bare_pc address as loaded in memory.
</PRE>
The rest is merely a matter of a bit of math to set up an ldir opcode to move
memory to the right place.

<P>After all that, and changing printf's to vdp_print equivalents, I now have
a lot more free memory!  It went from 6648 free bytes under CP/M to 23865 bytes
with no operating system and the memory relocation technique to use ROM space.
17217 extra!  That's a quarter of the total memory space.  Maybe there is even
enough to add networking to the game.

<A HREF="20251129%20Ask%20Grok%20about%20Compiing%20Nabu%20Code%20at%20Location%200.html">
I later asked Grok</A> about getting programs to run at location zero on the
Nabu.  It even went into a bit of detail about changing the Z88DK development
environment Nabu configuration file.  But at best, it's suggestion was to use
origin 0 in the assembler for the C runtime.  Half way there!

<H3>Load Screens and Music - Integrated and Improved</H3>

<P>While trying to make a title screen, I rewrote the screen loading code to
better integrate with music, so now it can:
<UL>
  <LI>Play music while loading!
  <LI>Also I changed one of the file formats from ASCII (35KB/screen) to binary
    (7KB/screen), 5 times faster, though at the expense of an extra step to
    prepare the data.
  <LI>Also, music and screens are now loadable from external files, either in
    your local NABU Internet Adapter directories or from my web site if it
    doesn't find a local copy.  That's thanks to D. J. Sure's NABU-LIB and
    Internet Adapter server functionality.  It means I can just distribute the
    .nabu file and you can run it without having to install the data files.
    And you can have different music for each level.
</UL>

<P>Unfortunately most of the example files that come with the music player
code are from copyrighted games, but I was able to find four songs from demos
that I could use.  I'll have to add a credits screen to the game for them.
Anyone want to try composing chip tunes?  The player comes with a music editor.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20251124%20Music%20and%20Load%20Screens.mp4"><IMG

<A HREF="20251124%20Music%20and%20Load%20Screens.mp4">20251124 Music and Load
Screens.mp4</A>

<P>That's the next job.  Designing an ASCII <I>Level File Format</I> that
specifies the screen, music, game variation, game tile layout (initial
power-ups, walls, etc), AI code, win and lose conditions (capture all the N
flag tiles, or N tiles in your colour, or highest score after N seconds, or
just a button push (for static screens), etc) to end the level, and name of
the next level to use when winning or losing.  Since it's text, you could make
your own levels.  You could even totally ignore the gameplay and use that level
scheme to just load screens and play music in a pick your own adventure book.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="2025.11.25"></A>2025.11.25</H2>

<H3>Level File Format</H3>

<P>What do we need to load a level and run it?
<UL>
  <LI><B>File name of the level.</B> Mostly for documentation purposes, so
    we'll just display a warning if it doesn't match the actual file name used
    to load the level.  No extension in this field; ".LEVEL" will be assumed
    (files like Game123.level, or Tutorial.level).  You can use lower case, but
    it will all be converted to upper case due to Nabu Internet Adapter
    limitations.  Also it has a maximum of 64 characters for file names.
  <LI><B>Type of Game to play.</B> Should we play Nth Pong wars, or display a
    static screen (option to limit input to the winner of the previous level
    for high score entry screens and trivia game answer screens), or show high
    scores, or show the settings screen?  Could even dynamically load code to
    play different kinds of games.
  <LI><B>Wining conditions.</B> What counts as a game over?  Which player wins
    (identified by colour)?  You have a choice of several gameplay rules, like
    first to reach a tile count of X (with an option to have the required count
    decreasing every second), or first player to control all of a set of tiles
    (list of tile row and column pairs needed), or first player to press their
    joystick button (useful for static screens or trivia contests), or a
    joystick direction move by any player (for multiple choice static screens),
    or a timeout.
  <LI><B>Win count increment.</B> Each time a particular player wins a level,
    their win count is incremented by this amount.  Can be zero.  This gets
    used for the high score screen, which shows current players and a top ten
    list with date stamps.
  <LI><B>Number of AI Players.</B> Human players get assigned a colour when
    they move the joystick, if there isn't an unused colour, they displace an
    AI player or other Human player.  Their win count gets reset to zero, score
    (tiles owned count) doesn't change.
  <LI><B>Next levels.</B> After a level has finished, what's the name of the
    next level?  We have four choices, named after the player colours, the
    winning player of the level gets their next level chosen (optionally it
    could be a random choice).  For multiple choice static screens, this can be
    input from a joystick direction.  For trivia games, this could be the first
    player to press their button.
  <LI><B>Name of Screen file.</B> This can be a full screen graphic (no font
    available, *.NFUL file name, 12KB, about 2 seconds to load), a character
    based screen and font and sprites (*.NSCR, 7KB, 1 second, required for game
    play), and just a screen full of characters using the current font (*.NCHR,
    1KB, fastest to load).  Or you can just leave the previous level's screen
    showing.
  <LI><B>Name of Music file.</B> The background music to be played.  For Nabu
    ChipNSFX files, game screens need to use tonal music in channels 1 and 2,
    noise instruments in channel 3, though the noise may go quiet due to player
    bugs.  Also the music should be relatively quiet so that the game sound
    effects are distinct.  The music gets loaded first so it plays while
    loading the background screen.
  <LI><B>Play Area Size.</B> For game levels, the size of the level (width and
    height in tiles).  The Nabu is limited to a total of 800 tiles due to
    memory space.  Lets you have long skinny play areas.
  <LI><B>Screen Tile Area.</B> Where the tiles are displayed on the screen,
    using top left corner row & column, and width & height.  There's also a
    play area location of the screen rectangle, maybe that will be automated to
    scroll the screen to follow a player in the play area, but it currently is
    set to (0,0) since scrolling is very slow.  Generally you'd make a screen
    (perhaps with a fake picture frame graphic) with an empty spot where the
    tiles will go.
  <LI><B>Tile Data.</B> A grid of ASCII characters, one for each tile.  Each
    line has as many characters as their are columns.  The number of lines
    should be the same as the number of rows.  After the data, there's a single
    line starting with "END", so we can pad missing rows or skip extra rows.
    The characters describe what's on each tile, things like a power-up, an
    empty tile, a wall tile, a player owned tile, etc.
  <LI><B>Tile Quotas.</B> A list of all the power-ups with the number desired
    to be on the board.  Every few seconds, the game will round-robin iterate
    through the types of power-ups, adding a new one at a pseudo-random
    location (advanced players can figure out the pattern, on purpose) if it is
    under quota.
  <LI><B>Introductory Text.</B> Some text that will be printed over the screen
    tile area.  Automatically word wrapped.  Use victory conditions to pause
    the screen so that it can be read until a button is pressed.
  <LI><B>AI Player Code.</B> A listing of the code needed for the AI players,
    and starting code location for each player.  Might have to write a
    mini-assembler so you don't have to type it in as numbers.  The
    instructions are things like go to this location, wait a certain amount of
    time, set speed, follow this player, chase the score leader, chase the
    Human score leader.
</UL>

<P>I'll use a keyword:value(s) general format for the file, with comments
marked by # at the beginning of a line and extra values usually separated by
commas.  There should be an example file with all the features shown and
commented about.  Look for it.

<P>Implementation is done by having a meta game loop, surrounding the normal
game frame loop.  Its input is the name of the level to play.  From that, it
loads artwork, sets up the board and runs the game until a winner is detected
(which sets the level file name to a new value).  Repeat until the magic "QUIT"
level file name is detected.

<H2><A NAME="2025.12.23"></A>2025.12.23</H2>

<H3>Menu Screens and Music</H3>

<P>I've had time to get more work done on the level loading.  It doesn't
actually load levels now, but it does load screens (graphical, font and text,
just text, ASCII print) and music (can play music while loading graphics).  If
it can't find the file locally, it tries my web server, so I don't need to
distribute all the files with the game, just the main executable.

<P>The little level loading language has progressed, see <A
HREF="20251223EXAMPLE.LEVEL.txt">EXAMPLE.LEVEL</A> for the current vocabulary.
Besides specifying what to display, it can take different actions when
different buttons are pressed, enough to do a triva game.  It can even start a
game of Nth Pong Wars, kind of useful :-).  But not yet load a level, just
create a new empty one of a given size.

<P>That's enough power to implement a title screen, credits, a demo mode with
timeout, and a game play level sequence, with win screens after each level.
For example, here's the title screen level file:

<PRE>
# Load the Nth Pong Wars title screen, it's a full screen picture.
GameMode: Trivia
Music: ONECOLN1
ScreenFull: TITLESCREEN

# If a direction is  selected, start the game or show credits etc, else
# wait 5 seconds and then show a demonstration of gameplay.
LevelNext: All, LEVEL001
LevelNext: Left, Quit
LevelNext: Right, CREDITS
LevelNext: Timeout, GAMEDEMO
PlayTimeout: 5

# Remove all players and reset win counts to zero.
RemovePlayers:
</PRE>

And here's an example of a level file.  Each winning player has a screen of its
own to display (usually with distinctive music per player), and with a kind of
subroutine bookmark scheme, it continues on to the next level once the win
screen has been acknowledged.

<PRE>
# Level #2.  AGMS20251210
GameMode: PongWar
Music: Silence
ScreenFont: NTHPONG1

# After showing the win screen, will go to the next level.
LevelBookmark: LEVEL003
LevelNext: All, LEVEL003
LevelNext: P0, WINP0
LevelNext: P1, WINP1
LevelNext: P2, WINP2
LevelNext: P3, WINP3
LevelNext: Fire, WINP4
LevelNext: Timeout, WINP5

MaxAIPlayers: 2
BoardSize: 32, 22
InitialCount: 200

ScreenText: 23, 5, 5, 32, _The sound of silence?_
</PRE>

<P>Here's a video of the typical sequence of screens.  First there's a title
screen and a few demonstration games, then a longer sequence of levels, each
with a longer game.  Eventually I'll have to put in a high score screen at the
end.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20251223NthPongSampleRun.mp4"><IMG

<A HREF="20251223NthPongSampleRun.mp4">20251223 Nth Pong Sample Run.mp4</A>

<P>Now it's starting to flow like a game.  After playing it a while, I need to
think over the gameplay, besides the AI getting stuck in a corner bug, the
player's ability to go really fast by pounding the Harvest button throws off
the gameplay balance.  Though it does make it very fast and exciting.

<H3>Running MAME on iPhone to play Nth Pong Wars!</H3>

<P>I was able to successfully emulate the NABU on my iOS 16 iPhone 8-Plus! And
run my NthPongWars game!

<P>There are a few steps. Download the "ArcadeMania" application, it's
published by Infinite Evolution Technologies, and currently implements MAME
0.283 (the most recent version).  Upload the various NABU ROMs to the iPhone.
It has various import routes, via iOS Files app (which I used to stuff files
directly in the ArcadeMania rom directory, maybe a mistake - got some extra
junk), or upload via a temporary web server it can run.  Once you've got the
ROMs loaded, you should see a NABU screen in the list of games available.

<P>You can run that NABU, but it boots up and just times out waiting for the
cable TV network adapter.  To fix that, hold-click on the NABU game in the
game listing to get to the advanced arguments. There you can type in:

<PRE>-hcca null_modem -bitb socket.123.123.123.123:5816</PRE>

<P>Replace the 123.123.123.123 with the address of your computer running the
Nabu Internet Adapter fake server, and adjust firewalls if necessary.
Unfortunately I don't know of a NIA for iOS, so you have to run it on a
computer somewhere else.  Indeed, I have the Nabu Internet Adapter
occasionally running on my web site so you can use it occasionally by typing in:

<PRE>-hcca null_modem -bitb socket.www.agmsmith.ca:5816</PRE>

<P>By the way, going over the cell phone network slows down loads by a factor
of four, compared to WiFi to a local NIA server.  Which makes loading screen
music painful to hear since it updates once every few hundred bytes and those
updates aren't coming fast enough.

<P>Now run the emulated NABU, and you'll see errors on the NIA complaining
about receiving $FF and not getting the hello message.  That's progress, you've
got a malfunctioning connection!  The problem is the emulated baud rate, which
you can change in the NABU MAME settings while running the game (when it's
displaying the MAME menu just before starting to run, pick Configure from
the pop-up menu, then use the joystick and buttons to navigate).  The Machine
Configuration menu has the baud rate, see the screen shot for working
settings.

SRC="20251228NabuMAMEArcadeManiaMachineConfiguration.jpeg" WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="552"
ALT="[Screen shot of ArcadeMania / MAME machine configuration for running NABU]"></A>

<P>If you boot up your NABU from my NIA, it will start in headless mode running
IMAGUI where you can pick from all the usual games and utilities, and use the
Local Source option at the very bottom of the categories list to get to Nth
Pong Wars.  Beware that the joystick action is a bit tricky, since going down
in the list of categories usually also triggers a sideways move and just
tapping the joystick also presses the fire button; it's best to rock the
joystick down along a curve covering the lower left quadrant.

<P>After that, the big joystick and buttons work and you can play Nth Pong
Wars!  Well, if you added the .nabu file from
<A HREF="../../NABU/">Alex's NABU Directory</A> to your
NIA or used my server.

<H3>AI that uses Power-ups!</H3>

<P>After doing some late night programming yesterday, I got the AI players to
make detours to pick up power-ups they are passing by.  Now they look like they
know what they're doing!  And the gameplay is more challenging since they can
go faster and do more damage when powered up.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20251230BetterAI.gif"><IMG
SRC="20251230BetterAI.gif" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="216"
ALT="[Yellow AI player being smart and grabbing power-ups]"></A>

<P>Note the yellow AI player here.  It's going down the right hand side of the
screen, accidentally hits a Fly power-up (looks like little blue wings
flapping), then diverts to a nearby Wide power-up (expanding white circles
thing) and snags it before it has flown too high up to touch anything on the
ground.  Conveniently the yellow player can now fly over all those blue tiles
to the corner then head left to the place where it wants to start tracing out
the letter "N".  On the way, it spots a Solid power-up (small white square
repeatedly filling in) and circles over it while the Fly power-up fades away.

<P>That's harder to do than you think, the problem is for the AI to check
nearby tiles.  There's no memory space for doubly linked lists of power-ups of
each kind (800 tiles times 4 bytes is 3.2 kilobytes) and no CPU for scanning
nearby tiles (radius of 9 would be 18x18 = 324 tiles) to look for power-ups.
Instead I keep small arrays of tile pointers for just the last 3 new power-ups
of each kind added to the board.  Then the AI just checks those 9 tiles
(3 types of "good" power-ups worth tracking, and each array has 3 or fewer
of the most recent tiles).  It's not perfect since the AI won't know about
old power-ups, but works well enough.

<P>The actual AI action when passing nearby a power-up (near is a distance
parameter the AI code can change) is to save its old target coordinates and
then change them to the closest power-up.  When it's done, it restores the
old target and resumes its normal behaviour.

<H3>Physics Reworked and Tutorial Levels</H3>

<P>As part of getting ready for the upcoming
<A HREF="https://vcfed.org/vcf-montreal/">Montreal Vintage Computer
Federation</A> convention, I decided to add some tutorial levels.  That meant
adding some tiles that could act as solid walls, keeping the players apart
while they learnt the basics.  Something that ended up looking like this:

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="20260116Tutorial.mp4"><IMG
SRC="20260116Tutorial.gif" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="216"
ALT="[Video of the tutorial levels, as of January 16 2026]"></A><BR>
<A HREF="20260116Tutorial.mp4">2026-01-16 Tutorial.mp4</A>

<P>By the way, the music is unique to the winning player.  Maybe I should
have a settings menu and a way of turning off the music :-)

<H4>Walls?  What walls?</H4>

<P>Of course, the first attempt didn't work too well.  Players could push their
way through walls by hitting the fire button repeatedly.  The trouble was that
the simulation code was just reversing the velocity when you got near a tile.
If you were thrusting into the tile, steering action would reverse it back
again and add a bit more velocity, until you got through.  Players could also
go part way through a tile if they were moving fast enough.

<P>The fix (found after drawing various player and tile situations on paper)
was to instead figure out which side of the tile the player was closest to,
and then push them back outside the tile if they were inside it.  I spent
several days overhauling the simulation code, calculating the push-back
distance and moving players away, and reducing the physics step size to half
a tile, so you would always be on the appropriate side, not out the back side
of the tile.  Also, don't let the players bounce off the sides of the tile
where there's another adjacent tile up against it - makes for some weird
backwards bounces.

<P>The result is that the frame rate slowed down yet again from the extra
physics steps and extra tile side calculations.  But now we have impermeable
walls!  I'm thinking of adding level options to turn off some of those extra
calculations, where wall accuracy isn't important, so you can go from 15
frames per second back to 20.  Or just have fewer players, or a faster computer.

<H4>Classic Pong Wars</H4>

<P>I tried to make a level to recreate the <I>Pong Wars</I> game which
inspired <I>Nth Pong Wars</I>.  As mentioned earlier, you can try out Koen
van Gilst's web page Javascript Pong Wars at
<A HREF="https://pong-wars.koenvangilst.nl/">https://pong-wars.koenvangilst.nl/</A>.
I faked it by having two AI players that just pick up speed and then drift
around, until they get bored and go to a corner.  Lots of Bash power-ups are
scattered around to help them simulate the one-hit destruction of tiles in the
original game.  However, it doesn't have the slight random variation in bounces
that Pong Wars has, or the mostly diagonal movement, or the fast speed (too
fast for gameplay?), but other than that it's identical! :-)

red player is handicapped by having a Fly power-up nearby, so they start flying
and don't leave tile trails for a while.  If you touch the joystick or
keyboard, you take over the green player.

<H4>Credits</H4>

<P>After the demo and on request, there's a sequence of credits screens
with an obvious Easter egg.

<H4>Quit</H4>

<P>You can also quit the game from the title screen or by hitting "q" on the
keyboard, which reboots the NABU or restarts CP/M (though the game is now too
large to fit in memory with CP/M).  You can also hit ESC on the keyboard to
get back to the title screen.

<H4>Main Game</H4>

<P>I've only put in three levels of the main game so far.  With walls, a lot
of different designs could be made, but that also requires some AI changes.
As usual, up to 4 players can play, just tap the joystick or hit the Yes key
to join in.  If you do nothing for 30 seconds, you get dropped from the game
and maybe replaced by an AI, which you can then take over from, by hitting
a key etc.

<P>I'll have to add some score keeping, for the number of levels won in a
campaign, and a high score screen to display that.  But that's something
for later.

<P>Hmmm, too easy.  I need to add an AI that always hounds the leading player,
not returning to their home corner at all.

<P>Anyway, it's not finished, but it's good enough to show at the VCF
convention.  It's one of the more recent NABU programs!  Well, until I port
it to terminal sessions using ncurses, then it will be most recent for some
other computer system - but not looking as good or sounding as great.
