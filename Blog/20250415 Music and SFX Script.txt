That rushing white noise is the harvesting sound, where players consume their own tiles for extra speed.
Here the music is slower because the frame rate has dropped to 20 per second, as you can see from the FC rather than FB indicator.
The green player has harvested enough to move at super fast speed, which our game code was designed to handle.
We're using the Chips and SFX Z80 AY-3-8910 chiptune library to play the sounds.
And that's the state of Nth Pong Wars in mid-April 2025.
